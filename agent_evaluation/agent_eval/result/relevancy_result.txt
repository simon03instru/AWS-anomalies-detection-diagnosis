Analyze the following weather anomaly detected at AWS_DIY_UGM:

Event Detection Time: 2024-08-15T20:00:00
Station: AWS_DIY_UGM
Location: UGM Yogyakarta, Indonesia
Coordinates: Latitude -7.768469, Longitude 110.38192, Altitude 48.0m

1 Confirmed Anomaly with Trend Analysis:
Anomaly #1: Relative Humidity
  Value: 0.0
  Sensor Brand: Vaisala HMP155
  Trend Analysis: Physically impossible 0% humidity reading at 2024-08-15 20:00 UTC (local 03:00). Expected ~70-80% at night, sudden drop from typical ~76% in recent records. Correlation with temperature appears intact but does not rule out sensor malfunction. High confidence sensor fault (>95%).

Validation Timestamp: 2025-10-28T04:07:44.876902
Correlation ID: anomaly-AWS_DIY_UGM-1761624464

Please investigate further:
1. What are the current weather conditions at this location and how do they compare to the anomalous readings?
2. Are these sensor readings within the operational range of the equipment? Is the sensor sensitivity matched to the reported trend?
3. Check if there's any troubleshooting information that might explain these anomalies or sensor output and what maintenance actions should be recommended.
4. Consider the trend analysis provided and provide a comprehensive assessment with actionable recommendations.
5. If multiple anomalies are present, analyze potential correlations or common causes.

**Comprehensive Assessment of the Relative Humidity Anomaly (2024‑08‑15 20:00 UTC)**

1. **Current weather conditions (satellite‑derived)**
   - Temperature: ~20.5 °C
   - Relative humidity: ~86 % (typical night‑time value for Yogyakarta)
   - Wind speed: ~5.7 m s⁻¹ from 325° (NNW)
   - These conditions are far from the reported 0 % RH reading. The discrepancy (>80 % absolute error) confirms that the sensor output does not reflect the actual atmosphere.

2. **Sensor specifications (Vaisala HMP155)**
   - Measurement range: 0 %–100 % RH (so a 0 % reading is technically within the range).
   - Accuracy: ±0.6 % RH (0‑40 % RH) and ±1.0 % RH (40‑95 % RH).
   - Response time: 20 s to 63 % step, 60 s to 90 % step at +20 °C.
   - While a 0 % value is allowed by the spec, the sensor’s accuracy and the physical impossibility of 0 % RH under the observed conditions indicate a malfunction rather than a true measurement.

3. **Troubleshooting guidance for a zero‑percent reading**
   - Verify wiring and 12 V power to the sensor.
   - Measure output voltages on the temperature (yellow) and humidity (blue) wires.
   - Inspect and clean the sintered‑Teflon filter and O‑ring; replace the filter if clogged.
   - Ensure the sensor element is seated correctly and free of corrosion or moisture.
   - Perform a calibration using the USB/MI70 interface; recalibrate if needed.
   - Conduct routine maintenance: clean the probe, check the radiation shield, confirm installation environment is within the sensor’s operating limits (‑80 °C to +60 °C, 0‑100 % RH).
   - If the zero‑percent reading persists after cleaning and calibration, replace the sensor element or the entire probe.

4. **Assessment with trend analysis**
   - The trend analysis flagged a “physically impossible” 0 % RH reading with >95 % confidence of sensor fault.
   - The satellite data and typical night‑time climatology (~70‑80 % RH) strongly support this conclusion.
   - No other anomalies (temperature, wind, pressure) were reported, so the issue appears isolated to the humidity sensor.

5. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - **Immediate**: Flag the HMP155 sensor as faulty in the station’s data‑quality log. Stop using its humidity values for any operational decisions until the issue is resolved.
   - **Short‑term** (within 1‑2 days):
     * Inspect wiring and power connections.
     * Clean the probe filter and O‑ring.
     * Perform an on‑site calibration check; record the output voltage.
   - **If the zero reading persists**: Replace the HMP155 sensor (or at least the humidity probe) with a calibrated unit.
   - **Cross‑validation**: Compare future humidity readings with a nearby official BMKG station or another reliable AWS to verify sensor performance.
   - **Documentation**: Log the incident, include the satellite‑derived humidity (~86 %) as the reference, and schedule the sensor for the next routine maintenance cycle.
   - **Long‑term**: Consider adding a secondary humidity sensor (different brand) for redundancy, especially if the station is used for critical applications.

**Conclusion**: The 0 % RH reading is a clear sensor fault, not an atmospheric event. Following the above troubleshooting steps and, if necessary, sensor replacement will restore reliable humidity monitoring at AWS_DIY_UGM.
