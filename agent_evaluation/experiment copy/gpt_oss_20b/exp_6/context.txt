  1. To troubleshoot zero humidity readings for the Vaisala HMP155, check the wiring and ensure connections to the correct input channels. Verify the power supply to the sensor, and check the output voltage if necessary. For cleaning, gently rinse the probe filter in distilled water and check for salt buildup, which can affect humidity readings. If needed, replace the probe filter annually and recalibrate the sensor to ensure accurate measurements.

  2. To troubleshoot and calibrate the Vaisala HMP155 humidity probe, follow these steps:

1. **Calibration**: Use a computer with a USB cable or the MI70 indicator. Adjust settings as needed for humidity measurement accuracy.

2. **Cleaning**: Ensure the probe is clean and free from obstructions. A sintered Teflon filter protects against water, dust, and dirt but should be checked regularly.

3. **Replacement**: If the probe is damaged or not functioning properly even after cleaning and calibration, consider replacing it with a new HMP155 or the relevant sensor components.

  1. The Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor has an operating range for relative humidity of 0% to 100%, with a resolution of 0.1%.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor specifications are as follows:
- **Relative Humidity Operating Range:** 0 to 100 %RH
- **Resolution:** Not explicitly mentioned, but accuracy is ±1 %RH (0 … 90 %RH) and ±1.7 %RH (90 … 100 %RH).


  1. The anomaly logs for `AWS_DKI_TAMAN_MINI` from 2024-10-20 to 2024-10-22 indicate that the detected issues were not caused by missing sensors or invalid data due to data logger programming. Each type of anomaly (invalid data or missing sensor) is independent, suggesting that there might be other factors at play affecting the readings during this period.

  2. The anomaly logs for AWS_DKI_TAMAN_MINI from October 20 to October 22, 2024, may relate to the HMP155 probe or its calibration with the mi70 indicator, as these components are interconnected through calibration requirements.

  1. The operational range sensitivity of the Vaisala HMP155 sensor is affected by maintenance factors, such as the condition of the probe filter and the presence of contaminants like salt or dust. These factors can lead to longer response times and decreased measurement accuracy. It's important to keep the sensor clean and to calibrate it annually for optimal performance.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 has an operational humidity measurement range of 0 to 100 %RH and a temperature measurement range of -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F). The accuracy of humidity measurements varies with temperature and humidity levels, with standard accuracies of ±1 %RH (0 to 90 %RH) and ±1.7 %RH (90 to 100 %RH) at +15 to +25 °C. The device is designed for reliable measurements even in challenging conditions.



  1. To troubleshoot the Vaisala HMP155 when it reports 0.0% relative humidity, follow these steps:

1. **Check Wiring**: Ensure that the sensor is wired correctly to the specified analog input channels.
2. **Verify Range Code**: Make sure the range code for the measurement instruction corresponds to the data logger type.
3. **Power Connection**: Check that the red power wire is correctly connected to the 12V or SW12V channel. For troubleshooting, connect it to a 12V terminal.
4. **Check Output Voltage**: Use a voltmeter to verify the output voltages for temperature and relative humidity.
5. **Inspect and Change Filter**: Inspect the probe filter; if contaminated, change it as needed (ideally once a year or more frequently in polluted environments).
6. **Check Calibration**: Recalibrate the HMP155A annually to ensure accuracy.
7. **Clean the Sensor**: Clean the sensor tip as debris can impact performance.

Additionally, check the sensor element and ensure no water or corrosion is present at the connections.

  2. For troubleshooting and maintenance of the Vaisala HMP155 humidity probe, consider the following recommendations:
1. **Regular Calibration**: Use a computer with a USB cable or the MI70 indicator for calibration to ensure accuracy.
2. **Inspect the Sintered Teflon Filter**: Ensure the filter is clean and not clogged as it protects against water, dust, and dirt.
3. **Check Probe Conditions**: Ensure the probe is not continuously exposed to high humidity levels that could lead to condensation. Use the warmed probe feature in high-humidity environments.
4. **Install Properly**: Ensure the probe is installed in appropriate radiation shields (DTR503, DTR13, or Stevenson screen) to protect against precipitation and radiation.
5. **Monitor Power Supply**: Ensure the operating voltage is within the specified range (7 – 28 V DC) to avoid malfunction.
6. **Observe Response Times**: Check the probe's response times under various conditions to ensure it meets specifications, especially in changing temperatures.
