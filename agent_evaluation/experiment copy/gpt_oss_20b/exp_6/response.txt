The anomaly report shows a relative humidity reading of 0.0 % at AWS_DKI_TAMAN_MINI on 2024‑10‑21 08:10 UTC. Satellite‑derived weather data for the same location and time (±1 h) indicates a relative humidity of ~64 %, a temperature of ~29 °C, and no precipitation. This large discrepancy strongly suggests a sensor fault rather than a genuine atmospheric condition.

Possible causes:
1. **Sensor calibration drift or failure** – The HMP155 is designed to measure 0–100 %RH with ±1 %RH accuracy. A 0.0 % reading is technically within range but unlikely under normal humidity, pointing to a calibration issue.
2. **Electrical or wiring problem** – Incorrect analog input connections, missing or incorrect range code, or power supply issues can produce zero output.
3. **Contaminated or clogged filter** – A dirty sintered Teflon filter can impede moisture flow, causing the sensor to read zero.
4. **Physical damage or corrosion** – Water ingress or corrosion at the sensor element can short the output.

Correlation with other anomalies:
- No other anomalies were reported for this station at the same timestamp, so this appears to be an isolated event.

Actionable recommendations:
1. **Verify wiring and power** – Check the analog input connections, confirm the range code matches the data logger, and ensure a stable 12 V supply.
2. **Inspect and clean the filter** – Replace the sintered filter if it appears dirty or clogged.
3. **Recalibrate the sensor** – Perform an annual calibration using the USB cable or MI70 indicator.
4. **Check sensor tip and element** – Clean the tip, inspect for corrosion or water damage, and replace the sensor if necessary.
5. **Monitor response times** – After maintenance, verify that the sensor’s response time meets specifications.
6. **Document the event** – Log the anomaly, maintenance actions, and any changes in sensor performance for future trend analysis.

By following these steps, the sensor should return accurate humidity readings, and the anomaly can be ruled out as a data error.
