  1. The operating temperature range for the Vaisala HMP155 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

  2. The operating temperature range of the Vaisala HMP155 is −80 to +60 °C (−112 to +140 °F).



  1. To troubleshoot a Vaisala HMP155 communication failure indicated by -9999°C, check the following:
1. Ensure the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels.
2. Verify the range code for single-ended or differential measurement instructions matches your data logger type.
3. Confirm the red power wire is correctly connected to the 12V or SW12V channel. 
4. Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal and check the output voltage with a voltmeter for temperature and relative humidity.
5. If the issue persists, check sensor wiring, voltage to the sensor, and SDI-12 address settings.

  2. For troubleshooting a communication failure with the Vaisala HMP155 resulting in a sentinel reading of -9999°C:
1. **Check Connections**: Ensure all cable connections, including the M12 connector and USB connection, are secure.
2. **Inspect Power Supply**: Verify that the probe is receiving adequate power (7 - 28 V DC).
3. **Check for Damage**: Inspect the probe and cables for any physical damage or wear.
4. **Calibration**: Use a computer or MI70 indicator to check if the sensor needs recalibration.
5. **Sensor Condition**: Evaluate the probe for contamination or blockages, especially if operating in high humidity environments; a warmed probe may help prevent condensation.
6. **Environment Factors**: Ensure the operating environment meets temperature and humidity specifications for the HMP155.

  1. To troubleshoot communication failure with the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, follow these steps:

1. **Check Wiring:** Ensure the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the measurement instructions.
2. **Power Supply:** Verify the red power wire is connected to the correct 12V or SW12V channel. For troubleshooting, connect it directly to a 12V terminal.
3. **Measure Output Voltage:** Use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires, respectively. 
   - Temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0
   - Relative Humidity % = mV * 0.1
4. **Verify Range Code:** Check that the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is correct for the data logger type.
5. **Check SDI-12 Communication:** Ensure the SDI-12 address matches what is entered in the instruction. Verify the voltage to the sensor is 12V.
6. **Check for Faults:** Inspect the sensor element connection for proper plugging and orientation, and check for water presence or corrosion around the sensor pins.
7. **Inspection for Contamination:** Ensure the sensor tip is clean and free from debris or salts.

  2. To troubleshoot communication failures with the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, consider the following steps:

1. **Check Connections**: Ensure that all connections are secure, including the USB connection for service use and any wired connections (RS-485 or voltage outputs).

2. **Power Supply**: Verify that the operating voltage is within the specified range (7 to 28 V DC). An inadequate power supply can lead to communication issues.

3. **Calibration**: Ensure the sensor is properly calibrated. Use a computer with a USB cable or the MI70 indicator for calibration checks.

4. **Environmental Conditions**: Assess the installation environment. The HMP155 is designed to function in harsh conditions, but extreme temperatures or humidity levels may affect communication.

5. **Firmware Updates**: Check if there are any firmware updates for the sensor that could improve communication reliability.

6. **Reset the Sensor**: If problems persist, try resetting the sensor to factory settings to resolve potential configuration issues.
