  1. The specifications for the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor include:
- **Measurement Range**: Typically covers from 0% to 100% relative humidity.
- **Sensitivity**: High sensitivity with a typical uncertainty of less than 1% per year when used in cleaner environments, but it can be higher in polluted air.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor has a measurement range of 0 to 100 %RH. Its sensitivity includes a response time of 20 seconds for 63% RH and 60 seconds for 90% RH at +20 °C in still air. Accuracy is ±1 %RH from 0 to 90 %RH and ±1.7 %RH from 90 to 100 %RH at temperatures between +15 to +25 °C.



  1. For troubleshooting the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor reporting zero percent humidity or unusual readings like –9999 or NAN, follow these steps:

1. **Check Wiring**: Ensure the sensor is correctly wired to the analog input channels as per the measurement instructions.
2. **Verify Power Supply**: Confirm that the red power wire is connected to the correct terminal (12V or SW12V).
3. **Power Connection**: For troubleshooting, connect the red wire to a 12V terminal.
4. **Check Output Voltage**: Use a voltmeter to check the output voltage on the yellow (temperature) and blue (humidity) wires.
5. **Verify Calibration**: Check that the multiplier and offset parameters are set correctly in the data logger program.
6. **Check for Contamination**: Inspect the probe filter and sensor for dirt/salt buildup. If needed, clean with distilled water or replace the probe filter.
7. **Annual Calibration**: Ensure that the HMP155A has been calibrated at least annually.

  2. For troubleshooting and calibration of the Vaisala HMP155 zero percent humidity sensor, you can perform calibration using a computer with a USB cable, with the push buttons, or with the MI70 indicator. Ensure to check the probe's performance against its specifications, which include observation range, accuracy, and response times for both humidity and temperature. If issues persist, consider replacing the sensor if it's found to be faulty, especially if it fails to provide accurate readings despite proper calibration.

  1. To troubleshoot a Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor reading 0%:
1. Check wiring: Ensure the sensor is correctly wired to the appropriate analog input channels.
2. Verify the power supply: Check that the red power wire is connected to the 12V terminal.
3. Use a voltmeter to check output voltages on the sensor's wires for temperature and humidity.
4. Inspect the filter: If the filter is contaminated or salt has built up, it may need cleaning or replacement.
5. Ensure proper calibration and verify settings in the data logger software.

  2. A 0% humidity reading in the Vaisala HMP155 can indicate potential issues such as a wet probe in a high-humidity environment, which can corrupt measurements. The probe may not provide accurate readings if it is exposed to fog, mist, or heavy dew. To troubleshoot, ensure that the sensor is not wet and is correctly calibrated. It may also require protection from precipitation and should be installed in an appropriate radiation shield for better performance.



  1. The operational range for the Vaisala HMP155 sensor is not explicitly listed in the provided context, but it typically measures relative humidity accurately. The sensitivity of the HMP155 is affected by factors like the condition of the probe, especially the cleanliness of the filter and sensor element.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 sensor has the following specifications for relative humidity:
- **Operational Range**: 0 to 100 %RH
- **Sensitivity/Accuracy**:
   - Accuracy (including non-linearity, hysteresis, and repeatability): 
     - ±1 %RH (0 … 90 %RH)
     - ±1.7 %RH (90 … 100 %RH)
     - Temperature-dependent accuracy: 
       - At +15 … +25 °C: ±(1.0 + 0.008 × reading) %RH
       - At -20 … +40 °C: ±(1.2 + 0.012 × reading) %RH
       - At -60 … -40 °C: ±(1.4 + 0.032 × reading) %RH
- **Response Time**: 63% response in 20 seconds, 90% response in 60 seconds at +20 °C in still air.


  1. To troubleshoot anomalous readings from the hygrovue 10 sensor used at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA, ensure that the data logger is properly recording data. Check for invalid data indicators like -999 or NaN, which may suggest calibration issues or physical errors that might not necessarily indicate a missing sensor.

  2. The sensor model used at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA for humidity and temperature measurements is the HMP155, which utilizes the Vaisala HUMICAPâ180R sensor. For calibration, the MI70 indicator is required. Troubleshooting anomalous readings may involve ensuring the proper installation of the sensor in a suitable radiation shield and checking for environmental influences, such as condensation. Calibration can be performed using a computer with a USB cable, directly via push buttons, or by connecting it to the MI70 indicator.


  1. The HMP155 sensor model used at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA has the following specifications:
- **Operating Temperature Range**: Not explicitly mentioned, but the sensor operates within standard measurement parameters.
- **Humidity Tolerance**: The sensor can get affected by salt build-up, particularly in coastal areas, which can compromise accuracy.
- **Known Calibration Issues**: Sensor element drift is less than 1% per year in cleaner environments; higher in polluted air. Recalibration is recommended annually as drift can affect accuracy.

  2. The sensor model used at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA is the Vaisala HUMICAPâ HMP155. Its operating temperature range is -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F) with a humidity tolerance of 0 to 100 %RH. Known calibration issues include factory calibration uncertainties of ±0.6 %RH (0 … 40 %RH) and ±1.0 %RH (40 … 95 %RH).
