Short Report – AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA (2025‑10‑03)

Weather Context
- Temperature: 25.5 °C – 26.5 °C (average 26.1 °C)
- Relative Humidity: 84 % – 89 % (average 86.6 %)
- Precipitation: None recorded

Sensor Specifications (HMP155)
- Operating temperature range: –80 °C to +60 °C
- Humidity tolerance: 0 %–100 % RH
- Calibration uncertainty: ±0.6 % RH (0–40 %) and ±1.0 % RH (40–95 %)
- Drift: <1 % per year in clean environments; higher in polluted air
- Recommended calibration: annually (or when drift detected)

Maintenance Insights
- Anomalous readings (e.g., –999, NaN) usually signal calibration or installation issues.
- Troubleshooting steps: verify logger communication, inspect mounting and radiation shield, check for condensation or extreme temperature swings.
- Calibration procedure: use MI70 indicator or built‑in push‑button mode; schedule quarterly or upon drift detection.

Anomaly Assessment
The observed weather conditions fall well within the sensor’s operating envelope, so the anomaly is unlikely to be caused by environmental extremes. Given the known calibration uncertainties and potential drift, a sensor‑related issue (e.g., drift, improper mounting, or communication error) is the most probable cause.

Actionable Recommendations
1. Verify that the data logger is recording correctly and that there are no communication errors.
2. Inspect the HMP155 sensor for proper mounting and ensure it is within a suitable radiation shield.
3. Check for condensation or rapid temperature changes that could affect readings.
4. Perform a calibration using the MI70 indicator or the sensor’s push‑button mode.
5. Schedule a quarterly calibration review and monitor drift indicators.
6. If anomalies persist after these steps, consider replacing the sensor.

Implementing these steps should restore accurate sensor performance and reduce false anomaly alerts.
