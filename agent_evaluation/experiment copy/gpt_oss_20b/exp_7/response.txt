At 2024‑10‑21 08:00 UTC the satellite‑derived weather at the AWS_DKI_TAMAN_MINI site (‑6.305489, 106.89966) shows a surface pressure of **1003.8 hPa**.  The temperature is 32.8 °C, relative humidity 51 %, wind speed 12.0 km h⁻¹ from the north‑northeast (16°), a light 0.1 mm precipitation, and direct solar radiation of 252 W m⁻².  The anomalous sensor reading of –9999.0 hPa clearly indicates a sensor fault or data corruption, as it lies far outside the normal operational range (≈950–1050 hPa).  The satellite data confirm that the pressure is within expected limits for the region and time of day.  Recommended actions: 1) Inspect and calibrate the BaroVue barometer; 2) Verify power and communication to the sensor; 3) Replace the sensor if faults persist; 4) Cross‑check with nearby stations for consistency.

The historical average atmospheric pressure at latitude -6.305489, longitude 106.89966 on 2024-10-21 at 08:00 UTC is 1003.8 hPa. This value is far from the reported anomaly of -9999.0, indicating a sensor error or data corruption.

No information found in sensor knowledge base

The -9999.0 pressure reading from BaroVue is considered invalid data, which may prompt maintenance actions. This type of invalid data is not caused by a missing sensor or adjustments to the sensor itself. The -9999.0 pressure reading from the BaroVue likely indicates a sensor malfunction or a reading error, which necessitates maintenance actions to ensure the device operates correctly.


The anomaly at AWS_DKI_TAMAN_MINI shows a pressure reading of –9999.0 hPa, which is clearly outside the expected operational range (≈950–1050 hPa). Satellite‑derived data for the same time and location indicate a surface pressure of 1003.8 hPa, confirming that the sensor output is erroneous. 

**Lack of Trend Analysis**
The system reports “No analysis available” for the pressure trend. Without a trend, we cannot determine whether the sensor was drifting, experiencing a sudden fault, or if the anomaly is isolated. A trend analysis would help differentiate between a transient glitch and a systematic calibration drift.

**Potential Correlations**
No other anomalies were reported for this station at the same timestamp, so there is no evidence of a common cause such as power loss or communication failure affecting multiple sensors. However, the absence of trend data and the single anomalous reading suggest a sensor‑specific fault.

**Actionable Recommendations**
1. **Inspect and Calibrate** – Physically inspect the BaroVue barometer for signs of damage or loose connections, and perform a factory calibration check.
2. **Verify Power and Communication** – Ensure the sensor’s power supply is stable and that data packets are being transmitted correctly. Check for any error logs or communication timeouts.
3. **Replace if Faulty** – If calibration or power checks do not resolve the issue, replace the sensor with a new BaroVue unit.
4. **Cross‑Check with Nearby Stations** – Compare pressure readings from adjacent weather stations to confirm the satellite data and rule out regional anomalies.
5. **Implement Trend Monitoring** – Enable automated trend analysis for pressure to detect gradual drifts or sudden spikes in future.
6. **Data Validation Layer** – Add a software filter that flags out‑of‑range values (e.g., <950 hPa or >1050 hPa) and triggers an alert before the data is used in downstream systems.

By following these steps, the sensor’s reliability can be restored, and future anomalies can be detected and addressed more promptly.
