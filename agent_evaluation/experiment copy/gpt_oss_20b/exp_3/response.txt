At 2024‑08‑19 01:00 UTC in Yogyakarta, the satellite‑derived weather shows a temperature of 24.3 °C, relative humidity of 76 %, wind speed of 9.5 m s⁻¹ and pressure of 1013.0 hPa. The observed wind speed is 0.5 m s⁻¹ below the anomalous 10.0 m s⁻¹ reported by the sensor, indicating a high but not extreme wind event, still far above the typical mean of ~1.8 m s⁻¹.


Compliance: 10.0 m/s is within the operational range (0–100 m/s) and above the sensitivity threshold (1.0 m/s).


Possible causes for the sudden spike to 10.0 m/s in the Young 05103‑L wind speed sensor and recommended maintenance actions:

1. **Wiring or Connection Issues**
   - Cause: Loose or incorrect wiring to the Pulse channel.
   - Action: Inspect and secure all connections; verify correct wiring diagram.

2. **Coil Resistance Problems**
   - Cause: Open coil (infinite resistance) or shorted coil (low resistance).
   - Action: Measure coil resistance between red and black wires; replace coil if out of spec.

3. **Incorrect Configuration Settings**
   - Cause: Mismatch of Configuration Code, Multiplier, or Offset in the Pulse Count instruction.
   - Action: Re‑enter correct configuration parameters for the datalogger type.

4. **Mechanical Wear or Damage**
   - Cause: Damaged propeller, shaft, or bearings causing erratic readings.
   - Action: Inspect propeller and shaft for obstructions or damage; replace bearings if noisy or worn.

5. **Potentiometer Fault**
   - Cause: Shorted or damaged potentiometer.
   - Action: Test potentiometer function; replace if faulty.

6. **Grounding or Static Issues**
   - Cause: Improper grounding leading to signal noise.
   - Action: Verify proper grounding and check for static discharge problems.

7. **Signal Conditioning Errors**
   - Cause: Faulty signal conditioning electronics amplifying noise.
   - Action: Inspect and test signal conditioning components; replace if defective.

8. **Datalogger Scan Rate or Overrun**
   - Cause: Inadequate scan rate causing program table overruns.
   - Action: Increase scan rate or adjust program table to prevent overruns.

9. **Calibration Drift**
   - Cause: Sensor calibration out of tolerance.
   - Action: Perform routine calibration checks and recalibrate if necessary.

10. **Environmental Interference**
    - Cause: Nearby obstructions or unusual weather affecting sensor.
    - Action: Assess installation site for obstructions; relocate sensor if needed.

Implement the above checks in order, documenting any findings and actions taken. If the spike persists after all corrective actions, consider replacing the sensor unit.
