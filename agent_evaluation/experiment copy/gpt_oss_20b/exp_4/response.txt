Unable to retrieve weather data for Yogyakarta at the requested time. The available data only covers up to 2024-08-19T01:00, which is outside the ±3‑hour window around 2024-08-19T07:40:00. Therefore, I cannot compare the anomaly values with current conditions.

The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor has an operating range of –80 °C to +60 °C. The anomaly reading of 10.92 °C falls well within this range. The sensor’s temperature sensitivity (accuracy) at 10.92 °C is approximately ±0.20 °C (calculated from the specification ±(0.226 – 0.0028 × T)). This is far smaller than the ~20 °C deviation observed, indicating that the large deviation is not due to the sensor’s inherent sensitivity but likely due to miscalibration, failure, or other error. Therefore, the anomaly temperature is within the operational range, but the sensor sensitivity does not explain the observed trend.

The search results for the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor miscalibration or failure provide the following maintenance and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Sensor Connection** – Verify that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified in the measurement instructions.
2. **Power Supply** – Ensure the red power wire is connected to the 12 V or SW12 V channel and that the sensor is powered during troubleshooting.
3. **Output Verification** – Use a voltmeter to check the output voltage on the yellow (temperature) and blue (humidity) wires.
4. **Parameter Check** – Confirm that the multiplier and offset parameters in the data logger programming match the desired units.
5. **Probe Filter and Shield** – Inspect the probe filter and radiation shield for contamination or salt buildup; replace the filter if dirty and clean the probe with distilled water.
6. **Calibration Method** – Ensure the probe has been calibrated using the correct method (USB, push buttons, or MI70 indicator). If calibration is missing or incorrect, perform a recalibration.
7. **Environmental Conditions** – Verify that the sensor is not exposed to excessive humidity or precipitation; use appropriate radiation shields (e.g., DTR503 or DTR13).
8. **Response Time** – Check that the sensor’s response times are within specifications (63 % within 20 s, 90 % within 35 s for temperature).
9. **Operating Limits** – Confirm that the sensor operates within its specified temperature range (−80 °C to +60 °C) and humidity range (0 %–100 % RH).
10. **Recalibration** – If all checks are correct and the anomaly persists, perform an annual recalibration or recalibrate under controlled conditions following Vaisala guidelines.

**Recommended Maintenance Actions for the Anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA**:
- Inspect and verify the wiring and power connections of the HMP155 at the station.
- Measure the output voltage on the temperature and humidity leads to confirm sensor output.
- Clean or replace the probe filter and ensure the radiation shield is intact.
- Recalibrate the sensor using the MI70 indicator or USB method.
- Verify that the sensor’s operating environment is within the specified limits and that no precipitation is directly contacting the probe.
- After recalibration, re‑monitor the temperature and humidity readings to confirm the anomaly has been resolved.

These steps are directly derived from the maintenance knowledge base search results and should address the miscalibration or failure indicated by the anomalous temperature reading.
