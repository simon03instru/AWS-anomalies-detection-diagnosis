1. The Vaisala HMP155 temperature operating range is unspecified in the provided context, but it emphasizes the importance of maintenance for accurate measurements. The accuracy of temperature and humidity readings can degrade due to contaminants on the sensor or incorrect wiring. Regular maintenance, including filter changes and cleaning, is crucial to maintain measurement accuracy and ensure proper temperature and humidity correlation.

 2. The Vaisala HMP155 temperature operating range is from -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F). The accuracy of the temperature measurement varies with the output method: for voltage output, it is ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × temperature) °C at -80 to +20 °C and ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × temperature) °C at +20 to +60 °C. The probe's humidity measurement accuracy includes  ±1 %RH (0 … 90 %RH) at +15 to +25 °C and varies outside this range.


1. To diagnose and correct Vaisala HMP155 temperature miscalibration and broken temperature-humidity correlation issues, follow these steps:

1. **Check Wiring and Connections:** 
   - Verify that the HMP155 sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified in the measurement instructions.
   - Ensure the red power wire is connected to the correct 12V or SW12V channel.

2. **Inspect Sensor and Probe:**
   - Ensure that the probe is securely mounted and clean. The radiation shield should be free from debris. 
   - Check the filter for contamination or blockages, which may require changing.
   - Make sure there are no salts or other contaminants affecting sensor performance.
   
3. **Measure Output Voltages:**
   - Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal and use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for both temperature and relative humidity.

4. **Verify Calibration Settings:**
   - Check that the multiplier and offset parameters for temperature and humidity are correct in the data logger program.
   - Recalibrate the HMP155 annually to ensure accuracy.

5. **Consider Environmental Factors:**
   - Evaluate if the sensor is installed near sources of contamination or electrical interference, which can affect readings.

If symptoms persist, consult the maintenance section for additional troubleshooting or consider replacing the element.

  2. To diagnose and correct the Vaisala HMP155 temperature miscalibration and broken temperature-humidity correlation, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Inspection**: Check for any visible signs of damage or misplacement in the probe installation, ensuring that the probe is properly installed in a suitable radiation shield (DTR503, DTR13, or Stevenson screen).

2. **Environmental Check**: Ensure the operating environment is within the specified ranges: temperature −80 … +60 °C (−112 … +140 °F) and humidity 0 … 100 %RH. Extreme conditions can affect readings.

3. **Calibration Verification**: Use the USB connection or the MI70 indicator to recalibrate the sensor. Confirm calibration settings match factory specifications, ensuring calibration uncertainty is within defined limits (+/- 0.6% RH at 0-40% RH, +/- 1.0% RH at 40-95% RH).

4. **Response Time Evaluation**: Test the response time of both humidity and temperature measurements. Ensure they meet specified response times (e.g., temperature probe's 63% response time should be <20 s in moving air).

5. **Sensor Cleaning**: If humidity readings are corrupted by environmental factors, clean the sintered Teflon filter or replace it if necessary, as blockages can lead to inaccurate readings.

6. **Electrical Check**: Inspect the connections and ensure they are secure. Verify that no wiring issues impact the sensor outputs.

7. **Replacement**: If calibration fails repeatedly or the sensor shows signs of wear, consider replacing the sensor or the temperature probe as a last resort.


  1. The sensitivity of the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor, which is a Pt100 temperature sensor, is represented by the formula: Temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0. This indicates that the sensor's output voltage in millivolts (mV) can be converted into temperature readings in degrees Celsius by applying the given conversion factor.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 temperature operating range is -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F). Its accuracy in this range varies; for instance, it is ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × temperature) °C at -80 to +20 °C and ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × temperature) °C at +20 to +60 °C.



  1. To troubleshoot miscalibration of the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor, check the following:

1. **Sensor Connection**: Ensure the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as per measurement instructions.
2. **Power Supply**: Verify the red power wire is properly connected to the 12V or SW12V channel and power the sensor for troubleshooting.
3. **Output Verification**: Use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires.
4. **Parameters Check**: Verify that multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units in the data logger programming.
5. **Sensor Maintenance**: Check the probe filter and radiation shield for contamination or salt buildup, as this can affect readings. Change the filter if necessary and clean the probe with distilled water.
6. **Recalibration**: Recalibrate the HMP155 annually or if persistent issues arise.

  2. To troubleshoot miscalibration failures in the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor, follow these steps:
1. **Check Calibration Method**: Ensure the probe has been calibrated using the correct method, such as through a computer with USB, push buttons, or the MI70 indicator, which is specifically designed for calibration.
2. **Inspect the Environment**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure it is not excessively humid or exposing the sensor directly to precipitation, as these conditions can affect measurements. Use radiation shields (like DTR503 or DTR13) to protect the sensor.
3. **Examine Sensor Integrity**: Assess if the sintered Teflon filter is clean and intact. Contamination or damage can lead to inaccurate readings.
4. **Check Response Time**: Evaluate the response times to ensure they are within specifications (63% within 20 seconds, 90% within 35 seconds for temperature readings).
5. **Consider Operating Conditions**: Confirm that the operating temperature and humidity are within specified limits (−80 to +60 °C and 0 to 100 %RH). If the sensor is operated outside these limits, it could affect calibration.
6. **Recalibrate if Needed**: If all checks are correct and issues persist, perform recalibration under controlled conditions, following Vaisala guidelines.
