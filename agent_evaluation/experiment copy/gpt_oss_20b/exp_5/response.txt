At 2024‑08‑19 07:40 UTC the satellite‑derived weather for Yogyakarta (lat -7.81665, lon 110.29481) shows a temperature of about 28.9 °C, relative humidity of roughly 57 % and direct solar radiation of ~465 W m⁻². The anomalous sensor reading of –9999.0 W m⁻² is a sentinel value that falls far outside the normal operating range (0–≈1000 W m⁻²) and indicates a sensor communication failure. The current conditions are typical for that time of day and do not support the anomalous value. Recommended actions: inspect the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 sensor for power, wiring, and firmware issues; recalibrate or replace the sensor if faults persist; verify that the sensor’s sensitivity and range match the expected radiation levels. No other anomalies were reported, so the issue appears isolated to this sensor.

The Kipp & Zonen CMP3 solar radiation sensor has an operational range up to 2000 W/m². The value -9999.0 W/m² is not within this range; it is a sentinel error value indicating a fault or communication failure, and therefore is outside the sensor’s valid measurement limits.

The sentinel value of -9999.0 W/m² on a Kipp & Zonen CMP3 sensor indicates a malfunction or error in measurement.  Troubleshooting steps: 1) Verify all sensor connections and cable integrity; 2) Ensure the sensor is properly calibrated and the calibration date is recent; 3) Inspect the sensor housing for physical damage, debris, or obstruction that could block sunlight; 4) Check the desiccant and internal components for proper function; 5) If the issue persists, recalibrate the sensor or contact Kipp & Zonen service/Calvin Scientific for further support.  Recommended maintenance actions: replace any damaged cables, clean the sensor aperture, replace the desiccant if expired, perform a factory calibration, and document the maintenance date and actions taken.

The anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA on 2024‑08‑19 07:40 UTC shows a sentinel value of –9999.0 W m⁻² for solar radiation, which is clearly outside the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 sensor’s valid range (0–2000 W m⁻²). Satellite‑derived weather for the same time and location indicates a temperature of ~28.9 °C, relative humidity of ~57 %, and direct solar radiation of ~465 W m⁻² – well within normal daytime values for Yogyakarta. Thus, the anomalous reading cannot be attributed to actual weather conditions but rather to a sensor communication or measurement failure.

**Sensor assessment**: The CMP3’s operational range confirms that –9999.0 W m⁻² is a sentinel error value, not a legitimate measurement. The trend analysis notes a broken correlation with temperature, further supporting a malfunction.

**Maintenance & troubleshooting**:
1. Verify power supply and cable integrity.
2. Check for firmware updates or reset the sensor.
3. Inspect the sensor housing for debris, damage, or obstruction that could block sunlight.
4. Test the desiccant and internal components for proper function.
5. If issues persist, perform a factory calibration or replace the sensor.

**Actionable recommendations**:
- Conduct a physical inspection of the CMP3, focusing on wiring, housing, and desiccant.
- Clean the aperture and ensure no obstructions.
- Update firmware and re‑calibrate according to manufacturer guidelines.
- Document all maintenance actions and schedule a follow‑up check within 48 hours.
- If the sentinel value recurs, replace the sensor.

No other anomalies were reported, indicating the issue is isolated to this sensor.

**Conclusion**: The anomalous solar radiation reading is due to a sensor fault, not an environmental event. Prompt inspection, cleaning, and calibration (or replacement) will restore accurate measurements.

The investigation found no additional anomalies reported for AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA. Consequently, there are no other data points to analyze for correlations or common causes. The sole anomaly—solar radiation sentinel value –9999.0 W m⁻²—appears isolated to the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 sensor and is attributed to a sensor malfunction rather than an environmental event.
