  1. The specifications for the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor include:
- **Measurement Range**: Typically covers from 0% to 100% relative humidity.
- **Sensitivity**: High sensitivity with a typical uncertainty of less than 1% per year when used in cleaner environments, but it can be higher in polluted air.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor has a measurement range of 0 to 100 %RH. Its sensitivity includes a response time of 20 seconds for 63% RH and 60 seconds for 90% RH at +20 °C in still air. Accuracy is ±1 %RH from 0 to 90 %RH and ±1.7 %RH from 90 to 100 %RH at temperatures between +15 to +25 °C.


  1. For troubleshooting the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor reporting zero percent humidity or unusual readings like –9999 or NAN, follow these steps:

1. **Check Wiring**: Ensure the sensor is correctly wired to the analog input channels as per the measurement instructions.
2. **Verify Power Supply**: Confirm that the red power wire is connected to the correct terminal (12V or SW12V).
3. **Power Connection**: For troubleshooting, connect the red wire to a 12V terminal.
4. **Check Output Voltage**: Use a voltmeter to check the output voltage on the yellow (temperature) and blue (humidity) wires.
5. **Verify Calibration**: Check that the multiplier and offset parameters are set correctly in the data logger program.
6. **Check for Contamination**: Inspect the probe filter and sensor for dirt/salt buildup. If needed, clean with distilled water or replace the probe filter.
7. **Annual Calibration**: Ensure that the HMP155A has been calibrated at least annually.

  2. For troubleshooting and calibration of the Vaisala HMP155 zero percent humidity sensor, you can perform calibration using a computer with a USB cable, with the push buttons, or with the MI70 indicator. Ensure to check the probe's performance against its specifications, which include observation range, accuracy, and response times for both humidity and temperature. If issues persist, consider replacing the sensor if it's found to be faulty, especially if it fails to provide accurate readings despite proper calibration.
