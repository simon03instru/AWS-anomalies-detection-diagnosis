**Assessment of the 2024-08-19 humidity anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA**

1. **Current weather vs. sensor values**
   - *Satellite‑derived conditions* (≈07:45 UTC): Temperature ≈ 28.8 °C, Relative Humidity ≈ 59 %, Solar Radiation ≈ 591 W/m².
   - *Sensor‑reported values*: Temperature 30.6 °C (≈+1.8 °C higher), Humidity 0 % (physically impossible given the ambient ~59 %), Radiation 523.8 W/m² (≈‑67 W/m² lower but still within normal morning variability).
   - **Conclusion**: Temperature and radiation are plausible; humidity is dramatically inconsistent with the ambient environment.

2. **Operational range check**
   - The Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor is rated for 0 %–100 % RH with ±1 % accuracy up to 90 % RH. While a 0 % reading is technically within the measurement range, such a value is extremely unlikely under typical atmospheric conditions, especially when surrounding humidity is ~60 %.
   - The abrupt drop from ~51 % (typical) to 0 % violates expected sensor dynamics (response time ≈20 s for 63 % RH). This indicates a sensor fault rather than a legitimate atmospheric event.

3. **Troubleshooting & maintenance guidance** (Vaisala HMP155)
   1. Verify wiring and correct connection to analog input channels.
   2. Confirm 12 V power supply is present on the red wire.
   3. Measure output voltage on the yellow (temperature) and blue (humidity) wires; values should be within spec.
   4. Check that multiplier and offset parameters are correctly configured in the data logger.
   5. Inspect and clean the probe filter; replace if contaminated.
   6. Perform an annual calibration using the USB interface or MI70 indicator.
   7. If the sensor still reports 0 % after the above steps, replace the sensor.

4. **Comprehensive assessment & actionable recommendations**
   - **Root cause**: The humidity sensor is most likely malfunctioning (electrical fault, contamination, or internal degradation). The temperature and solar radiation sensors appear to be operating correctly.
   - **Immediate actions**:
     * Conduct the wiring and power checks outlined above.
     * Measure sensor output voltages to confirm signal integrity.
     * Clean the probe filter with distilled water.
   - **Short‑term actions** (within 24‑48 h):
     * Re‑calibrate the HMP155 using the manufacturer’s procedure.
     * If calibration does not restore realistic humidity values, schedule a sensor replacement.
   - **Long‑term actions**:
     * Implement a routine verification of humidity readings against nearby reference stations or satellite data to catch similar faults early.
     * Log all maintenance actions and calibration certificates for audit.
   - **Data handling**: Flag the 2024‑08‑19 humidity data point as invalid and exclude it from climatological analyses. Retain temperature and radiation data for that timestamp.

5. **Correlation with other anomalies**
   - No other sensor anomalies were reported for this event; temperature and radiation values are consistent with external observations, so no multi‑parameter correlation is evident.

**Overall recommendation**: Treat the humidity reading as erroneous, follow the step‑by‑step troubleshooting, recalibrate, and if necessary replace the HMP155. Continue monitoring humidity trends after corrective actions to confirm sensor health.
