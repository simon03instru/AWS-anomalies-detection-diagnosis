**Assessment**
- The satellite‑based weather data for Yogyakarta at 07:45 UTC on 2024‑08‑19 shows a wind speed of ~20 m s⁻¹, which is roughly double the 10 m s⁻¹ reported by the Young 05103‑L sensor and about five times the site’s typical mean (≈1.8 m s⁻¹). Temperature (≈28.8 °C), pressure (≈993.6 hPa) and humidity (≈59 %) are normal for late‑August, confirming that a strong wind event was occurring.
- The Young 05103‑L sensor’s operational range is 0‑75 mph (≈0‑33.5 m s⁻¹) with ±2 % full‑scale accuracy, so a 10 m s⁻¹ reading is technically within its limits. However, the reading is significantly lower than the ambient wind, indicating an under‑reporting fault rather than an out‑of‑range condition.

**Possible Causes**
1. **Mechanical issue** – damaged propeller, worn bearings, or debris causing reduced rotation speed.
2. **Electrical problem** – open/short coil, loose or corroded wiring, grounding issues, or faulty potentiometer output.
3. **Configuration error** – incorrect multiplier/offset or datalogger scan‑rate causing missed pulses.
4. **Installation obstruction** – sensor positioned near structures that shield wind.

**Recommended Action Plan**
1. **Immediate Verification**
   - Compare the sensor’s 10 m s⁻¹ value with a nearby reliable wind source (e.g., another AWS or nearby airport) for the same 07:30‑08:00 UTC window.
   - Retrieve raw pulse‑count data (if available) to see whether the sensor recorded fewer pulses than expected.
2. **Physical Inspection**
   - Check wiring connections, especially the pulse channel, and tighten any loose terminals.
   - Measure coil resistance; it should be ~2075 Ω. Replace coil if resistance is infinite or significantly low.
   - Inspect the propeller and bearings for wear, damage, or blockage; replace if needed.
   - Verify the sensor is mounted at the recommended height, clear of obstructions, and oriented up‑wind.
   - Ensure proper grounding to eliminate static‑induced false signals.
3. **Configuration Review**
   - Confirm the Configuration Code, Multiplier, and Offset match the datalogger specifications.
   - Check for program table overruns; increase the scan rate if the wind‑speed input is being missed.
4. **Calibration**
   - After any repairs, perform a full calibration against a calibrated anemometer or a trusted reference station.
   - Record the calibration factor and update the sensor’s configuration.
5. **Monitoring**
   - Enable high‑frequency logging (e.g., 1‑minute intervals) for the next 24‑48 hours to detect any recurring spikes or drops.
   - Set an alert threshold (e.g., >5 m s⁻¹ deviation from nearby stations) to catch future anomalies early.

**Conclusion**
The 10 m s⁻¹ reading is anomalously low given the observed ~20 m s⁻¹ ambient wind and, while within the sensor’s nominal range, likely reflects a sensor fault (mechanical or electrical). Following the verification, inspection, configuration check, and recalibration steps outlined above should identify the root cause and restore accurate wind‑speed reporting.
