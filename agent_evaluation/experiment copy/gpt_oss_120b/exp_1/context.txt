  1. To troubleshoot a Vaisala HMP155 communication failure indicated by -9999°C, check the following:
1. Ensure the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels.
2. Verify the range code for single-ended or differential measurement instructions matches your data logger type.
3. Confirm the red power wire is correctly connected to the 12V or SW12V channel. 
4. Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal and check the output voltage with a voltmeter for temperature and relative humidity.
5. If the issue persists, check sensor wiring, voltage to the sensor, and SDI-12 address settings.

  2. For troubleshooting a communication failure with the Vaisala HMP155 resulting in a sentinel reading of -9999°C:
1. **Check Connections**: Ensure all cable connections, including the M12 connector and USB connection, are secure.
2. **Inspect Power Supply**: Verify that the probe is receiving adequate power (7 - 28 V DC).
3. **Check for Damage**: Inspect the probe and cables for any physical damage or wear.
4. **Calibration**: Use a computer or MI70 indicator to check if the sensor needs recalibration.
5. **Sensor Condition**: Evaluate the probe for contamination or blockages, especially if operating in high humidity environments; a warmed probe may help prevent condensation.
6. **Environment Factors**: Ensure the operating environment meets temperature and humidity specifications for the HMP155.
