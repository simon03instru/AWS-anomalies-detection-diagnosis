The observed weather at the AWS_DKI_TAMAN_MINI site (lat -6.305489, lon 106.89966) around the requested time (08:00 local = 01:00 UTC on 2024‑10‑21) shows a temperature of about 29.5 °C, relative humidity near 63 %, surface pressure around 1008.4 hPa, wind speed roughly 9.7 m/s from a direction of 117° (south‑south‑east). The reported sensor reading of –9999.0 hPa is far outside the normal atmospheric pressure range (typically 950–1050 hPa) and clearly erroneous. The satellite‑derived pressure is consistent with typical sea‑level values for Jakarta, confirming that the barometric sensor is malfunctioning or reporting a placeholder error code. All other observed parameters appear normal for the region and time of day.


The search results indicate that the BaroVue 10 atmospheric pressure sensor's valid pressure measurement range is not explicitly provided in the available information. Consequently, we cannot confirm whether the anomalous reading of -9999.0 hPa falls within its operational range. The documentation mentions that error conditions may be signaled by pressure (and temperature) values returned as NaN, but no specific error codes for out‑of‑range values are listed.

Troubleshooting steps for a BaroVue pressure sensor returning a -9999.0 placeholder reading include: 1) Verify all sensor connections (white, red, black wires) and ensure the sensor card is fully inserted and correctly oriented. 2) Measure supply voltage with a digital voltmeter, confirming the red wire is connected to a non‑switched 12 V terminal if required. 3) Confirm the SDI‑12 address of the BaroVUE 10 matches the system configuration. 4) Perform a calibration check; if data quality is poor, send the sensor card to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. 5) Check that the sensor firmware is current and update if needed. 6) Ensure the sensor is operating within its specified pressure range. 7) Inspect the sensor for physical damage or environmental issues. 8) If readings remain erroneous after these steps, replace the sensor card, observing anti‑static precautions.

Assessment: The atmospheric pressure reading of -9999.0 hPa from the BaroVue sensor at AWS_DKI_TAMAN_MINI is clearly erroneous. Satellite‑derived pressure at the event time (2024‑10‑21 08:00 local, ~01:00 UTC) was about 1008.4 hPa, which is typical for Jakarta and well within the normal sea‑level range (≈950‑1050 hPa). The reported value falls far outside any realistic range and matches the placeholder error code used by BaroVue when the sensor fails or data are unavailable. No trend analysis is available and no other anomalies were reported, so correlation with other parameters is unlikely. Possible causes include: sensor communication fault, power‑supply issue, incorrect SDI‑12 address, firmware glitch, physical damage, or the need for recalibration. Recommended actions: 1) Verify all sensor wiring (power, ground, data) and ensure the sensor card is fully seated. 2) Measure the supply voltage (should be a stable 12 V if required). 3) Confirm the SDI‑12 address matches the system configuration. 4) Run a sensor self‑test or calibration check; if data quality is poor, send the sensor to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. 5) Check and update the sensor firmware if a newer version is available. 6) Inspect the sensor for physical damage or environmental contamination. 7) If the reading remains -9999.0 after these steps, replace the BaroVue pressure sensor. After corrective actions, monitor the pressure readings to ensure they return to normal values and align with satellite‑derived observations.
