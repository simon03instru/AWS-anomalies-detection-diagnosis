The current weather conditions at the location (-6.305489, 106.89966) show a temperature around 32.75°C, relative humidity approximately 51-52%, and surface pressure near 1003.75 hPa. The humidity levels are within typical operational ranges and are significantly higher than the anomalous reading of 0.0. This suggests that the sensor anomaly is likely due to a sensor malfunction or calibration issue rather than actual environmental conditions, as such low humidity readings are physically implausible in this context.

The Vaisala HMP155 sensor is a humidity and temperature sensor designed for environmental monitoring. Its typical operational range for relative humidity is 0% to 100%, and for temperature, it generally operates from -40°C to +60°C. The sensor's sensitivity and calibration can potentially produce a humidity reading of 0.0%, especially if the sensor is exposed to very dry conditions or if there is a calibration issue or malfunction. Given that the operational range includes 0% humidity, a reading of 0.0% is technically within the sensor's capabilities, but it may also indicate a sensor fault or calibration error. Further troubleshooting and calibration verification are recommended to confirm the accuracy of such readings.


The troubleshooting procedures for the Vaisala HMP155 sensor indicate that issues such as zero humidity readings can be caused by wiring problems, environmental factors, dirty filters, or calibration needs. Key steps include verifying correct wiring, inspecting and cleaning the sensor and its filter, checking environmental conditions, and recalibrating the sensor if necessary. Ensuring proper electrical connections and operating conditions is also crucial. These actions help address common failures and maintain accurate humidity measurements.

The current weather data retrieved for the location indicates that the temperature is around 32.75°C, with a relative humidity of approximately 51-52%, and surface pressure near 1003.75 hPa. These conditions are typical and do not explain the anomalous zero humidity reading. The sensor's operational range includes 0% to 100% humidity, so a reading of 0.0% is within the sensor's capabilities but likely indicates a malfunction or calibration issue rather than actual environmental conditions. Troubleshooting steps such as verifying wiring, inspecting and cleaning the sensor, and recalibrating are recommended to address potential faults. The trend analysis shows no available data, which further suggests a sensor fault rather than environmental cause.
