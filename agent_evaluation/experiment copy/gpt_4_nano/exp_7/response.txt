The current weather conditions at TMII, Indonesia, show a temperature around 32.8°C, with light precipitation of 0.1 mm, relative humidity approximately 51-52%, windspeed about 12 m/s, and surface pressure near 1003.8 hPa. These conditions are within typical ranges for the region and do not indicate any abnormal atmospheric pressure or other extreme weather phenomena. The previously reported sensor anomaly with a pressure reading of -9999.0 is likely due to a sensor malfunction or data error, as the current surface pressure is normal. No immediate troubleshooting or maintenance actions are required based on the current data, but it is recommended to verify sensor calibration and operation to prevent future anomalies.

The specific operational range and sensitivity specifications for the BaroVue atmospheric pressure sensor are not detailed in the available sensor knowledge base. Generally, BaroVue sensors like the Vaisala Barocap Digital Barometer PTB210 are designed to operate within typical atmospheric pressure ranges (approximately 300 to 1100 hPa) with high sensitivity suitable for weather monitoring. However, exact numerical values for the operational range and sensitivity are not provided in the current data. For precise specifications, consulting the manufacturer's datasheet or technical documentation is recommended.

The anomalies at AWS_DKI_TAMAN_MINI, including the invalid pressure reading of -9999.0, may be linked to environmental factors such as humidity fluctuations affecting the Vaisala Barocap Digital Barometer PTB210. Common causes could include humidity levels exceeding operational limits or sensor malfunctions. No direct evidence suggests power issues or missing sensors are contributing to these anomalies. It is recommended to verify environmental conditions, inspect sensor connections, and consider calibration or replacement if environmental factors are within operational ranges. Further monitoring is advised to determine if anomalies persist under stable conditions.
