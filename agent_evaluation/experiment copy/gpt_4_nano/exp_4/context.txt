  1. ### Troubleshooting Guides for HMP155 Sensor:

1. **Symptoms of Issues:**
   - Relative Humidity reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%:
     - Check wiring to the correct analog input channels.
     - Verify the range code for measurement instructions.
     - Ensure the red power wire is correctly connected to the appropriate 12V channel.
     - Use a voltmeter to check output voltage.
   - Incorrect temperature or relative humidity:
     - Verify multiplier and offset parameters are correct for desired units.

### Maintenance Procedures for HMP155 Sensor:

1. **Preventive Maintenance:**
   - Securely mount the probe and check radiation shield and cable integrity.
   - Clean radiation shield with mild detergent and a soft cloth.
   - Change probe filter annually or more frequently in polluted environments.

2. **Changing the Probe Filter:**
   - Remove the filter by rotating it counterclockwise. Check and change the O-ring if necessary, then install the new filter.

3. **Regular Checks:**
   - Monthly inspections of the radiation shield for debris and contaminants on the probe tip.
   - Rinse the filter gently in distilled water if necessary. Check for salt buildup if the sensor is near saltwater.
   - Recalibrate the sensor annually.

  2. To troubleshoot and maintain the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, follow these guidelines:

1. **Calibration**: Use a USB cable to connect the sensor to a computer for calibration. You can also use the push buttons or the MI70 indicator.

2. **Environmental Considerations**: Ensure the sensor is protected from precipitation, direct solar radiation, and harsh environments. Install it in recommended radiation shields (DTR503, DTR13, or Stevenson screen).

3. **Warmed Probe**: If measuring in high-humidity environments, utilize the optional warmed probe to prevent condensation and ensure reliable measurements.

4. **Response Time Monitoring**: Monitor the response times under various conditions to ensure the sensor is functioning correctly:
   - 63% RH: 20s (with sintered Teflon filter)
   - 90% RH: 60s

5. **Long-term Stability**: Regularly check for stability and accuracy over time as the sensor is designed for long-term use with the HUMICAPâ 180R sensor inside.

6. **Visual Inspection**: Check for any visible damage to the sintered Teflon filter and housing, and ensure all connections (e.g., M12 connector) are secure.

7. **Power Supply**: Confirm that the operating voltage is between 7 and 28 V DC, paying attention to the minimum required voltage for the selected output type.

By following these procedures, accurate and reliable measurements can be maintained.



  1. The Vaisala HMP155 sensor features a temperature operational range that is not explicitly detailed in the provided context, but it utilizes a Pt100 temperature sensor that is soldered to the probe, suggesting a capability to measure a wide range of temperatures. The sensitivity of the sensor can be inferred from the troubleshooting notes, specifically that temperature in °C can be determined using the formula:  \( \text{temperature (°C)} = \text{mV} \times 0.14 - 80.0 \), indicating a sensitivity in the mV output respective to temperature changes.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 sensor has an operational temperature range of −80 to +60 °C (−112 to +140 °F). Its sensitivity, which is indicated by accuracy, is ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × temperature) °C for the range of −80 to +20 °C and ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × temperature) °C for +20 to +60 °C when using voltage output.



  1. Issues related to broken temperature-humidity correlation or anomalous temperature readings in Vaisala HMP155 sensors can be addressed through preventive maintenance and troubleshooting actions. Specific steps include:

1. **Check Wiring and Connections**: Ensure that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels and verify the voltage connections.

2. **Verify Measurement Parameters**: Check that the range code and multiplier/offset parameters are set correctly.

3. **Inspect the Probe and Filter**: Regularly check that the probe is securely mounted and the filter is clean. Change the probe filter annually or more frequently in polluted environments.

4. **Identify Faulty Readings**: Symptoms such as readings of –9999, NAN, or unchanging values indicate issues that may be related to wiring, contamination, or sensor malfunctions.

5. **Sensor Calibration**: Recalibrate the HMP155A annually to ensure accurate readings. If drift occurs, consider replacing the sensor element as it may degrade over time.

6. **Address Environmental Factors**: Monitor for any build-up of salts or other contaminants that can affect readings, especially in coastal areas.

Following these actions can help resolve issues related to broken temperature-humidity correlation and ensure the proper functioning of the HMP155 sensors.

  2. Issues related to broken temperature-humidity correlation in the Vaisala HMP155 sensors can arise due to environmental factors such as fog, mist, rain, and heavy dew that may cause measurements to be corrupted. Additionally, the performance can be adversely affected if the sensor's probe is wet, leading to inaccuracies. Maintenance actions may include ensuring proper installation in radiation shields like the DTR503 or DTR13 to protect against direct solar radiation and precipitation. Calibration may also be necessary using USB or MI70 indicator to maintain measurement reliability.

  1. The trend analysis indicating a large negative deviation at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA suggests significant issues affecting data reliability. Given the relationships outlined:

1. **Missing Sensor**: If a sensor is physically missing, it directly affects data collection reliability.
2. **Invalid Data**: The presence of invalid data (e.g., erroneous readings) signifies that the remaining sensors are not functioning correctly or the data recorded is not usable.
3. **Power Issues**: Unstable or insufficient power can lead to both missing sensors (if devices shut down) and invalid data.

Since the analysis highlights a broken correlation, it implies that the expected relationships between data inputs have faltered, possibly due to the inability to gather data from all sensors or discrepancies in data integrity. This signals a critical need for infrastructure review, especially regarding sensor functionality and power supply stability.

  2. The trend analysis indicates a large negative deviation at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA, suggesting that the expected measurements from the humidity and temperature probe (HMP155) are not aligning with actual data. This could be due to calibration issues related to the mi70 indicator, which is essential for calibrating the probe. The broken correlation may imply that the relationships between the indicators (mi70 and hmp155) and their manufacturer (vaisala) are not functioning as intended, possibly due to faulty calibration or manufacturing inconsistencies.


  1. The calibration issues with the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor may arise from several factors: 

1. **Contamination of the Probe Filter**: Over time, the probe filter can become contaminated, leading to longer response times and decreased measurement accuracy. Changing the filter regularly is essential, especially in polluted environments.

2. **Wiring and Power Supply Issues**: Ensure that the sensor is correctly wired to the specified analog input channels and that the power supply is stable at 12V. Faulty connections can lead to erroneous readings such as –9999 or NAN.

3. **Electrical Interference**: Ensure the sensor is not installed near radio transmitters or cell phones, as this can interfere with readings.

4. **Recalibration Requirement**: The HMP155A sensor should be recalibrated annually to maintain measurement accuracy. Factory recalibration may be necessary if significant drift in measurement is observed.

5. **Inspection of Sensor Element**: Issues with the sensor element itself, such as improper connection or contamination, can result in faulty readings. Regular inspection and replacement of the sensor element may be necessary to ensure reliable operation.

  2. Sensor calibration issues with the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor may arise due to factors such as environmental conditions affecting measurements, the need for regular calibration using a USB connection, push buttons, or with the MI70 indicator. Additionally, ensuring the sensor is protected from moisture and extreme conditions can improve measurement stability and accuracy.
