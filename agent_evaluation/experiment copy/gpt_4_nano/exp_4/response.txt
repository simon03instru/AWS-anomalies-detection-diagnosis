The current weather conditions in Yogyakarta show temperatures around 29.0°C at 07:30 and 28.8°C at 07:45, with relative humidity levels at approximately 58-59%. These readings are typical for the region and do not indicate any abnormal weather patterns at this time. The previously reported anomalous temperature of 10.92°C is likely due to sensor malfunction or calibration issues, as current measurements are within normal operational ranges.

The Vaisala HMP155 sensor operates within a temperature range of -80 to +60 °C, which comfortably covers the observed anomaly at Yogyakarta (-7.81665 latitude, 110.29481 longitude, altitude 48m). Its sensitivity varies with temperature, with an accuracy of ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × temperature) °C in the -80 to +20 °C range and ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × temperature) °C in the +20 to +60 °C range. Given the sensor's operational range and sensitivity, it is capable of accurately measuring the temperature at the observed anomaly, and the sensor's specifications do not suggest a limitation that would explain the large negative deviation (~20°C below the mean). The anomaly is likely due to other factors such as sensor calibration issues or environmental influences rather than the sensor's operational constraints.

I have retrieved the troubleshooting guides and maintenance procedures for the Vaisala HMP155 sensor. They include checks for wiring, calibration, environmental protection, filter replacement, and regular maintenance steps to ensure proper operation and address issues such as incorrect readings or sensor failure. These guidelines should help diagnose and resolve the anomalies observed in the sensor readings at the Yogyakarta station.

The issues with broken temperature-humidity correlation or anomalous temperature readings in Vaisala HMP155 sensors can be caused by environmental factors such as fog, mist, rain, and heavy dew, which may corrupt measurements. Maintenance actions include verifying wiring and connections, inspecting and cleaning the probe and filter regularly, ensuring proper calibration annually, and installing the sensor in protective radiation shields like DTR503 or DTR13 to prevent direct solar radiation and precipitation effects. Recalibration or replacement of the sensor element may be necessary if drift or malfunction is detected. These steps can help address sensor malfunctions and improve measurement accuracy.

The trend analysis indicates a significant negative deviation and broken correlation likely caused by sensor calibration issues or environmental influences affecting the Vaisala HMP155 sensor. The current weather conditions are normal and do not explain the anomaly, suggesting sensor malfunction rather than environmental factors. Maintenance actions should include calibration verification and sensor inspection to restore data accuracy.


The calibration issues with the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor may arise from several factors: 

1. **Contamination of the Probe Filter**: Over time, the probe filter can become contaminated, leading to longer response times and decreased measurement accuracy. Changing the filter regularly is essential, especially in polluted environments.

2. **Wiring and Power Supply Issues**: Ensure that the sensor is correctly wired to the specified analog input channels and that the power supply is stable at 12V. Faulty connections can lead to erroneous readings such as –9999 or NAN.

3. **Electrical Interference**: Ensure the sensor is not installed near radio transmitters or cell phones, as this can interfere with readings.

4. **Recalibration Requirement**: The HMP155A sensor should be recalibrated annually to maintain measurement accuracy. Factory recalibration may be necessary if significant drift in measurement is observed.

5. **Inspection of Sensor Element**: Issues with the sensor element itself, such as improper connection or contamination, can result in faulty readings. Regular inspection and replacement of the sensor element may be necessary to ensure reliable operation.

Sensor calibration issues with the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor may arise due to factors such as environmental conditions affecting measurements, the need for regular calibration using a USB connection, push buttons, or with the MI70 indicator. Additionally, ensuring the sensor is protected from moisture and extreme conditions can improve measurement stability and accuracy.
