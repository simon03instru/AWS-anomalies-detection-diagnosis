The current weather data for Yogyakarta, Indonesia, shows a temperature around 29°C, with no precipitation detected, and relative humidity near 58-59%. Wind speeds are approximately 20.1 m/s, and direct solar radiation levels are around 492 to 451 W/m². Surface pressure is approximately 993.7 hPa. These conditions are typical for the region and do not indicate any anomalies. The sensor readings for solar radiation previously noted as invalid due to a communication failure are likely due to sensor malfunction, and current satellite-based data does not show any abnormal weather conditions. Maintenance should focus on checking and repairing the solar radiation sensor to restore accurate measurements.


The current weather conditions in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, show temperatures around 29°C, with no precipitation and relative humidity near 58-59%. Wind speeds are approximately 20.1 m/s, and direct solar radiation levels are around 492 to 451 W/m². These conditions are typical for the region and do not indicate any anomalies. The previously noted invalid solar radiation reading of -9999.0 W/m² is likely due to sensor malfunction, as current satellite-based data shows normal radiation levels. Maintenance should focus on checking and repairing the solar radiation sensor to restore accurate measurements.


The Kipp & Zonen CMP3 sensor has an operational range of 0 to 2000 W/m² and a sensitivity of approximately 5 to 20 µV/W/m². Its maximum operational irradiance is 2000 W/m², and it functions within a temperature range of -40°C to +80°C. These specifications indicate that the sensor is suitable for measuring typical solar radiation levels encountered in outdoor environments, with sensitivity calibrated to detect variations within its operational range. The sensor's sensitivity and range are aligned with standard solar radiation measurement requirements, ensuring accurate readings under normal conditions.


The Kipp & Zonen CMP3 sensor has an operational irradiance range of 0 to 2000 W/m² and a sensitivity of approximately 5 to 20 µV/W/m². Its temperature operating range is from -40°C to +80°C. The anomalous value of -9999.0 W/m² is far outside the sensor's operational range, indicating a sensor malfunction or communication failure rather than a valid measurement. The trend analysis indicating an invalid sentinel value aligns with the sensor's specifications, as such a value is not physically plausible within its operational limits. Therefore, the anomalous reading is not within the sensor's operational limits and is likely due to sensor failure or communication issues, not actual environmental conditions.


The troubleshooting guides for the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 sensor include verifying wiring connections, checking for condensation, ensuring proper calibration, inspecting for electromagnetic interference, and maintaining the sensor's cleanliness. Regular cleaning and periodic recalibration (every two years) are recommended. If abnormal readings occur, verify the wiring, measure impedance, and check the sensor cable condition. For persistent issues, consult the technical specifications or contact Kipp & Zonen support. These procedures aim to address common sensor malfunctions such as invalid readings, unrealistic values, or signal variations, which are relevant to the anomaly detected.

Note: The CMP3 sensor is similar to the CMP6 and SMP6 models, which feature improved performance and lower maintenance requirements, including the use of desiccants and minimal upkeep.
The sensor's operational range and sensitivity should be checked against the reported trend to ensure proper functionality.
Known issues with the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 sensor related to invalid sentinel values and broken correlation with temperature include improper calibration and potential data integrity problems. Maintenance actions recommended are to verify and recalibrate the sensor using the MI70 indicator, check all wiring and connections for security, and ensure the sensor's calibration is up-to-date. Regular calibration and inspection can help prevent such anomalies and ensure accurate readings.
The trend analysis indicates that the invalid sentinel value of -9999.0 W/m² and the broken correlation with temperature are due to a sensor communication failure, likely caused by issues such as power problems, cabling, or data logger programming. The sensor's operational range is 0 to 2000 W/m², and the anomalous value is outside this range, confirming malfunction. Maintenance should focus on verifying and repairing the solar radiation sensor, checking wiring and connections, and recalibrating the sensor to restore accurate measurements and re-establish proper correlation with temperature.
The analysis confirms that the solar radiation sensor (Kipp & Zonen CMP3) is malfunctioning due to communication failure and broken correlation with temperature, indicated by the invalid sentinel value -9999.0 W/m². Troubleshooting and maintenance should focus on verifying and repairing the sensor, inspecting wiring and connections, and recalibrating the sensor to restore accurate measurements and proper correlation. Regular cleaning, checking cable integrity, replacing desiccants if applicable, and ensuring calibration are recommended actions. Additionally, monitoring environmental conditions and verifying the sensor's physical condition can prevent future issues. Implementing these maintenance actions will help restore sensor functionality and improve data reliability.
