  1. The Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer is designed to measure solar radiation. Regarding its operational range and sensitivity, specific details are not directly provided in the context. Generally, the operational range for pyranometers like the CMP3 can vary, but they are typically sensitive to a wide spectrum of solar radiation, including both direct sunlight and diffuse sky radiation. The sensitivity is influenced by factors such as calibration, environmental conditions, and sensor design, with the need for recalibration recommended every two years to ensure accuracy.

  2. The Kipp & Zonen CMP3 sensor operates within a range of 0 to 2000 W/m² and has a sensitivity of 5 to 20 µV/W/m². Its operational temperature range is from -40 °C to +80 °C, and it also has a relative humidity range of 0 to 100%.

  1. The issues related to the invalid sentinel value and broken correlation with temperature in the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 sensor can be attributed to factors such as erroneous data or improper sensor adjustments. Since invalid data is specifically not caused by the presence of a missing sensor or sensor adjustments, troubleshooting should focus on recalibrating or adjusting the sensor settings to ensure accurate temperature readings, as well as verifying the data integrity.

  2. The Kipp & Zonen CMP3 sensor may experience issues with invalid sentinel values and broken correlation with temperature due to improper calibration. To address these issues, it is essential to ensure that the associated HMP155 humidity and temperature probe is properly calibrated using the MI70 indicator and the appropriate USB connection cable. Regular maintenance actions should include checking the calibration status of the sensor and ensuring that all connections are secure.


  1. The trend analysis indicates a sensor communication failure if invalid data is present, such as sentinel values like -999, NaN, or extreme temperatures. The node relationships suggest that invalid data is not caused by missing sensors, which implies that other factors like power issues, cabling, or programming of the data logger may be involved. Additionally, the presence of a missing sensor is identified as a separate issue that does not directly cause invalid data. Therefore, the analysis points to potential underlying problems in data integrity rather than simple sensor absence.

  2. The trend analysis indicates a potential issue with sensor communication failure and correlation breakdown due to the interconnected nodes. The cmp6 pyranometer, which is compliant with ISO 9060:2018, plays a crucial role in solar monitoring for PV systems. If communication with cmp6 is compromised, it could disrupt solar monitoring applications, leading to broken correlations in data collection and analysis. Monitoring compliance with ISO standards is essential to ensure accurate performance and reliability of the system.
