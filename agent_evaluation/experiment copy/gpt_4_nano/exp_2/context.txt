       - At +15 … +25 °C: ±(1.0 + 0.008 × reading) %RH
       - At -20 … +40 °C: ±(1.2 + 0.012 × reading) %RH
       - At -60 … -40 °C: ±(1.4 + 0.032 × reading) %RH
- **Response Time**: 63% response in 20 seconds, 90% response in 60 seconds at +20 °C in still air.


  1. To troubleshoot anomalous readings from the hygrovue 10 sensor used at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA, ensure that the data logger is properly recording data. Check for invalid data indicators like -999 or NaN, which may suggest calibration issues or physical errors that might not necessarily indicate a missing sensor.

  2. The sensor model used at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA for humidity and temperature measurements is the HMP155, which utilizes the Vaisala HUMICAPâ180R sensor. For calibration, the MI70 indicator is required. Troubleshooting anomalous readings may involve ensuring the proper installation of the sensor in a suitable radiation shield and checking for environmental influences, such as condensation. Calibration can be performed using a computer with a USB cable, directly via push buttons, or by connecting it to the MI70 indicator.
