The current weather conditions in Yogyakarta, Indonesia at 2024-08-19T07:40:00 show a temperature of approximately 29.0°C and a relative humidity of 58%. This is significantly different from the anomalous relative humidity reading of 0.0% reported by the sensor, which is physically impossible and indicates a likely sensor malfunction. The relative humidity readings from the weather data are within a normal range, suggesting that the sensor at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA is not functioning correctly. Given the trend analysis indicating a drop from typical levels to 0%, it is recommended to inspect and possibly recalibrate or replace the sensor to ensure accurate readings in the future.


The Vaisala HMP155 sensor has an operational range for relative humidity readings from 0% to 100% RH and temperature readings from -80°C to +60°C. It utilizes the Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor, which is designed for long-term stability. The sudden drop to 0% humidity from a typical reading of ~51% indicates a likely malfunction, as this is outside the expected operational behavior. Preventive maintenance for this sensor includes checking the probe and radiation shield, cleaning the shield, and changing the probe filter annually. Troubleshooting should also involve ensuring proper wiring and checking battery voltage to address incorrect readings. Given the anomaly, it is recommended to inspect the sensor for physical damage or contamination and perform necessary maintenance actions to restore accurate functionality.


To troubleshoot the 0% humidity reading on the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, follow these steps: 1. Check Wiring: Ensure the sensor is properly wired to the correct analog input channels. 2. Power Supply: Verify that the red power wire is securely connected to the 12V or SW12V channel. 3. Check Output Voltage: Use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for temperature and relative humidity. 4. Inspect the Probe: Ensure the probe is securely mounted and the radiation shield is intact. 5. Probe Filter: Replace the probe filter if contaminated. 6. Element Check: Inspect the sensor element for proper connection and check for corrosion. 7. Calibration: Recalibrate the HMP155 annually. Additionally, check for condensation on the probe, use the warmed probe feature in high humidity, and ensure the sensor operates within its specified ranges. If issues persist, consult the manufacturer's guidelines or contact technical support.


The analysis of the weather anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA indicates that the relative humidity sensor reported an impossible value of 0.0%, while the actual conditions showed a relative humidity of 58% at a temperature of approximately 29.0°C. This discrepancy suggests a likely malfunction of the Vaisala HMP155 sensor. To address this issue, it is recommended to inspect the sensor for wiring issues, verify the power supply, check the output voltage, and ensure the probe is properly mounted and clean. Regular calibration should also be performed annually. If the problem persists after these checks, contacting technical support or considering a replacement of the sensor may be necessary to ensure accurate readings in the future. Overall, immediate maintenance actions are advised to restore reliable data collection.
