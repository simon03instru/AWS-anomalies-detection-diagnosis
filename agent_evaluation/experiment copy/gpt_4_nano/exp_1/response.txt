The current weather data for Yogyakarta, Indonesia on August 19, 2024, shows a temperature of approximately 29.2°C at 07:15, with relative humidity at 57%. There was no recorded precipitation during this time. This data indicates that the sensor anomaly reported (temperature reading of -9999.0°C) is indeed outside the operational range of the equipment, as the expected temperature is well within the normal range of -50 to 60°C. Immediate maintenance and troubleshooting of the sensor are recommended to address the communication failure and ensure accurate readings in the future.

The current weather data for Yogyakarta, Indonesia, around the time of the anomaly shows temperatures of approximately 29.0°C at 07:30 and 28.8°C at 07:45, with relative humidity levels of 58% and 59%, respectively. This is significantly different from the anomalous temperature reading of -9999.0°C, which indicates a sensor communication failure. The expected temperature range is between -50°C and 60°C, making the sensor's reported value impossible and far outside operational parameters. Immediate maintenance is recommended to address the sensor issue and ensure accurate readings in the future.

The operational temperature range for the Vaisala HMP155 sensor is −80 to +60 °C (−112 to +140 °F).

The temperature reading of -9999.0°C falls outside the operational range of the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, which is −80 to +60 °C. This reading is an invalid sentinel value indicating a sensor communication failure, confirming that the temperature reading is impossible and far outside the expected range.

The error code -9999.0°C for the Vaisala HMP155 sensor indicates a communication issue or a problem with the sensor element itself. To troubleshoot: 1. Check sensor wiring to ensure correct connections. 2. Verify that the sensor is receiving 12V power. 3. Ensure the SDI-12 address matches your setup, if using SDI-12. 4. Inspect for corrosion or water under the sensor element connector. 5. If needed, swap the sensor element for another to check for faults. The `-9999.0°C` reading typically indicates a sensor fault or malfunction due to factors such as wet probe, electrical connection issues, calibration issues, environmental conditions, or a faulty sensor that may require replacement.

To address the Vaisala HMP155 sensor issue with a reading of -9999.0°C, follow these troubleshooting steps: 1. Check wiring to ensure correct connections. 2. Verify that the sensor is receiving 12V power. 3. Check the output voltage for temperature with a voltmeter. 4. If using SDI-12, ensure the sensor's address matches your setup. 5. Inspect for moisture or corrosion under the sensor element connector. 6. Clean or replace the sensor element if contaminated. 7. Recalibrate the sensor annually. 8. Replace the probe filter if clogged. If the issue persists, consult the manufacturer for further assistance. These actions will help resolve the communication failure indicated by the invalid sentinel value.

The current temperature readings at Yogyakarta, Indonesia, around the time of the anomaly are as follows: at 07:00 UTC, the temperature was 29.4°C, decreasing to 28.5°C by 08:00 UTC. This is significantly higher than the anomalous reading of -9999.0°C, which indicates a sensor communication failure. The sensor's operational range is between -50°C and 60°C, making the reported anomaly impossible. It is recommended to check the sensor connections and perform maintenance to ensure proper functionality. No other anomalies were detected in the provided data, but further monitoring is advised to prevent future occurrences.

The analysis of the temperature anomaly at Yogyakarta indicates a confirmed sensor communication failure, as evidenced by the invalid reading of -9999.0°C. Current weather conditions show a temperature of 29.4°C at 07:00 UTC, decreasing to 28.5°C by 08:00 UTC, which is well within the operational range of the sensor (-50°C to 60°C). It is recommended to check the sensor connections and perform maintenance to ensure proper functionality. Continuous monitoring is advised to prevent future anomalies, although no other anomalies were detected at this time.
