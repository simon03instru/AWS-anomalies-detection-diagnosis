  1. The operational pressure range of the Vaisala PTB110 atmospheric pressure sensor is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is important to note that the PTB110 does not require regular maintenance and has no replaceable parts, which suggests it is designed for durable use. Its sensitivity is not detailed either, but if malfunctioning, it should be replaced. The mention of ‘-9999.0 hPa’ likely indicates a placeholder for pressure readings outside of the operational limits.

  2. The specification for the Vaisala PTB110 atmospheric pressure sensor is not directly provided in the context. However, it mentions the PTB210, which is a reliable outdoor barometer for harsh conditions and includes different pressure ranges and operational humidity conditions. The sensitivity for the PTB110 is noted as -9999.0 hPa, but specific operational pressure ranges are not available in the provided information.



  1. The communication failure of the Vaisala PTB110 pressure sensor showing -9999.0 hPa could indicate invalid data. This might stem from various issues, but it is notably not caused by a missing sensor or require sensor adjustment. To troubleshoot, check the sensor's connections, and verify that it is correctly configured and operational.

  2. To troubleshoot the Vaisala PTB110 pressure sensor communication failure indicated by -9999.0 hPa, first ensure that the sensor is operating within the correct humidity conditions and pressure range specified for the device. Check the connections and power supply to the sensor, as well as any potential environmental factors affecting its operation.
