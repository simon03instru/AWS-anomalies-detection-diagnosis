Assessment:
- At the event time (2024‑08‑19T07:40:00 UTC) satellite‑derived data show a wind direction of ~156° (south‑south‑east) and a wind speed of ~20 m s⁻¹, indicating a strong, normal wind. The sensor reported –9999.0°, which is a sentinel value outside the valid 0‑360° range and therefore does not reflect actual conditions.
- The Young 05103‑L wind‑direction sensor’s operating range is 0‑360° with 0.5° resolution. The –9999.0° reading is clearly invalid, confirming a communication or hardware fault rather than a measurement error.
- Maintenance guidance for this sensor lists the following diagnostic steps: verify installation and cable connections, check power supply, confirm data integrity, power‑cycle the unit, update firmware, recalibrate, and test individual components. Corrective actions include repairing/re‑installing cables, replacing a faulty sensor, cleaning/re‑calibrating, ensuring proper power, and contacting Young support if the issue persists.
- Recommendation:
  1. Perform the diagnostic checklist immediately (inspect wiring, power, reset the device).
  2. If the sensor continues to output –9999, replace the Young 05103‑L unit.
  3. After repair/replacement, recalibrate the wind monitor and verify data against the next satellite observation.
  4. Log the fault and schedule routine checks to prevent future communication failures.
- No other anomalies were reported, so the issue is isolated to the wind‑direction sensor.
Overall, the anomaly is a sensor fault, not a meteorological event. Prompt hardware inspection and possible replacement are required to restore reliable wind‑direction reporting.


At the timestamp 2024-08-19T07:40:00 for station AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA, no other sensor anomalies were recorded in the maintenance knowledge base. The only reported issue is the wind direction sensor anomaly (value -9999.0) likely caused by sensor communication failure. No additional anomalies were found to suggest correlations or common causes.
