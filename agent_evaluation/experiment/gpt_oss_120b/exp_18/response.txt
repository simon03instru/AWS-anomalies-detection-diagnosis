**Assessment**: The pressure sensor (Vaisala PTB110) at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit reported an implausibly low value of 100.58 hPa at 2024‑08‑16 15:30 UTC. Satellite‑derived observations for the same location and time show a normal surface pressure of 1006.1 hPa, temperature 12.1 °C, wind speed 22 m/s, and relative humidity 88 %. The discrepancy of ~905 hPa confirms a sensor fault rather than a real atmospheric event.

**Likely Causes**
1. Sensor malfunction or internal electronics failure causing an erroneous low‑pressure code.
2. Possible condensation or water ingress damaging the pressure transducer (high humidity environment).
3. Calibration drift or loss of reference pressure.
4. Physical blockage or debris affecting the sensor inlet.

**Operational Range**: The Vaisala PTB110 is designed for typical atmospheric pressures (≈300–1100 hPa). A reading of 100.58 hPa is far outside its valid measurement range, indicating the sensor is out of spec.

**Troubleshooting & Maintenance Recommendations**
1. **Verify sensor status** – check for error codes (e.g., -999, NaN) in the data stream.
2. **Inspect physical condition** – look for condensation, water ingress, debris, or damage to the sensor housing.
3. **Confirm environmental limits** – ensure temperature and humidity are within the sensor’s operating envelope.
4. **Perform a calibration check** following Vaisala PTB110 procedures; recalibrate if drift is detected.
5. **Reset or power‑cycle** the sensor to clear transient faults.
6. **Relocate the sensor** if the installation site is prone to moisture or blockage.
7. **Replace the sensor** if inspection reveals irreversible damage or if calibration/reset does not restore plausible readings.

**Actionable Steps for AWS_DKI_KebunBibit**
- Immediately flag the pressure data as invalid and exclude it from any real‑time analyses.
- Conduct the diagnostic steps above within the next maintenance window.
- Document any physical findings (e.g., moisture, debris) and corrective actions taken.
- If the sensor cannot be restored to normal operation, procure a replacement PTB110 unit and schedule installation.
- After repair/replacement, perform a post‑maintenance validation by comparing the sensor’s pressure output to satellite‑derived pressure for at least 24 hours to confirm accuracy.

**Conclusion**: The pressure anomaly is almost certainly due to a sensor fault. Following the outlined troubleshooting and maintenance actions should resolve the issue and restore reliable pressure measurements at the station.
