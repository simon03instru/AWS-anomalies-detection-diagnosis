  1. The operational temperature range specifications for the Vaisala HMP155 are not explicitly detailed in the provided context. However, it is noted that the HMP155 uses a Pt100 temperature sensor, which typically operates within a range of similar industrial devices, often between -50 °C to +100 °C. The response characteristics can decline if maintenance protocols are not followed, particularly if the sensor element is contaminated, affecting measurement accuracy.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 has an operational temperature range of -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F), making it suitable for various environmental conditions. Its response characteristics for temperature measurement include a response time of <20 seconds for 63% and <35 seconds for 90% precision in 3 m/s (7 mph) airflow.



  1. To troubleshoot sudden low temperature readings in the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, first ensure the sensor is correctly wired to the appropriate analog input channels and that the power is correctly supplied to the sensor. Check for any signs of damage or contamination on the sensor element and probe filter. If the readings are still incorrect, verify the calibration settings and replace the probe filter and O-ring if needed, as a contaminated filter can affect measurement accuracy. Recalibrate the sensor annually to maintain accuracy.

  2. To troubleshoot sudden low temperature readings from the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, consider the following steps:
1. **Check Calibration:** Ensure the sensor is calibrated properly. It can be calibrated using a computer with a USB cable, push buttons, or with the MI70 indicator.
2. **Inspect for Faults:** Look for any visible damage to the sensor or its connections, especially if there has been exposure to harsh environmental conditions.
3. **Confirm Installation:** Ensure the probe is installed correctly and is in a suitable environment. The HMP155 is designed for outdoor applications but should be protected from direct solar radiation and precipitation.
4. **Examine Warmed Probe Functionality:** If the humidity is near saturation, the optional warmed probe may not be functioning correctly, affecting temperature readings.
5. **Check Power Supply:** Verify that the power supply to the sensor is within required levels (7 to 28 V DC) and that there are no issues with the wiring.
6. **Consider Replacement:** If troubleshooting does not resolve the issue, consider replacing the sensor or the probe, especially if it is out of warranty.
