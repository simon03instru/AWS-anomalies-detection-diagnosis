### Comprehensive Assessment of Solar Radiation Anomaly (AWS_DIY_UGM)

**1. Weather Conditions at the Time of Anomaly**
- **Timestamp:** 2024‑08‑15 10:30 local (03:30 UTC)
- **Direct Solar Radiation (satellite‑derived):** **431 W/m²**
- **Air Temperature:** **29 °C**
- **Relative Humidity:** **56 %**
- **Implication:** Clear, sunny daytime conditions with ample solar energy reaching the surface. The observed radiation is far above the historical early‑morning mean (~36 W/m²) and well within typical daytime values (hundreds of W/m²). Therefore, the reported sensor value of **0 W/m²** is inconsistent with the ambient environment and cannot be explained by weather.

**2. Sensor Operational Range & Sensitivity**
- **Sensor Model:** Kipp & Zonen **CMP3** pyranometer.
- **Typical Output Range (CMP6 reference):** 0 – 1500 W/m².
- **Sensitivity (CMP6 reference):** 5‑20 µV / W/m².
- **Interpretation:** While a 0 W/m² reading lies at the lower bound of the nominal range, a functional pyranometer under clear‑sky conditions should report a positive value (hundreds of W/m²). The zero reading therefore indicates a loss of signal rather than a legitimate measurement.

**3. Troubleshooting Findings (Common Causes of Zero‑Radiation Output)**
| Potential Cause | Diagnostic Check | Recommended Action |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Wiring/terminal mis‑connection | Verify correct polarity and secure connections at the data logger | Re‑terminate cables, ensure proper connector type and tightness |
| Incorrect calibration factor in logger | Review logger configuration for CMP3 calibration constant | Re‑enter correct factor from sensor calibration certificate |
| Short circuit / water ingress (low impedance) | Measure sensor impedance (≈100 Ω + cable) with multimeter | Dry/repair sensor housing, replace damaged cable, reseal connectors |
| No voltage output (thermopile failure) | Disconnect sensor, expose to a 60 W incandescent source; expect ~2.5 mV | If no voltage, replace the pyranometer unit |
| Dome obstruction (dirt, dew, frost, insects) | Visual inspection of sensor dome | Clean dome with soft cloth, ensure proper ventilation/shielding |
| Power‑supply issue | Check logger power rails and sensor supply voltage | Restore stable power, replace faulty power module |
| Electromagnetic interference | Observe noise spikes in logger data | Add proper grounding, use shielded cable, relocate sensor if needed |

**4. Actionable Recommendations**
1. **Immediate Visual Inspection** – Go to the station, clean the pyranometer dome, and confirm there is no physical obstruction (dust, leaves, water). 
2. **Electrical Verification** – With the logger offline, measure the sensor’s open‑circuit voltage under a known light source (e.g., 60 W bulb). Confirm the expected ~2.5 mV output. 
3. **Cable & Connector Check** – Inspect all wiring for corrosion, loose terminals, or water ingress. Replace any damaged sections and reseal connectors. 
4. **Calibration Review** – Open the data‑logger configuration, verify that the correct CMP3 calibration factor is entered. Re‑apply the factor from the latest calibration certificate if needed. 
5. **Impedance Test** – Measure sensor impedance; values significantly lower than ~100 Ω indicate a short. If shorted, the sensor likely needs replacement. 
6. **Power Supply Audit** – Ensure the logger’s power supply is stable and within the sensor’s required voltage range. Replace any faulty power modules. 
7. **Cross‑Check with Nearby Reference Station** – Compare simultaneous radiation data from a nearby reliable station (e.g., a national meteorological network) to confirm that ambient radiation is indeed ~400 W/m². This helps isolate the fault to the local sensor. 
8. **Documentation & Logging** – Record all inspection steps, test results, and any component replacements in the station maintenance log. 
9. **Post‑Repair Validation** – After corrective actions, monitor the sensor for at least 24 hours to verify that readings track expected diurnal patterns and match the reference station. 

**5. Correlation with Other Anomalies**
- No other sensor anomalies (temperature, humidity, wind) were reported for the same timestamp. The isolated nature of the zero‑radiation reading further points to a sensor‑specific fault rather than a systemic station issue.

**Overall Conclusion**
The solar radiation anomaly is almost certainly due to a malfunction of the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer (wiring, calibration, or component failure). Weather conditions at the time were clear and would have produced ~400 W/m², making the 0 W/m² reading implausible. Follow the step‑by‑step troubleshooting and maintenance actions above to restore accurate solar radiation measurements.

I examined the weather data for AWS_DIY_UGM (Latitude -7.768469, Longitude 110.38192) from 02:30 UTC to 04:30 UTC on 2024‑08‑15, which brackets the anomaly detection time of 03:30 UTC (10:30 local). The data show normal conditions: temperature rose from 27.3 °C to 30.0 °C, relative humidity fell from 63 % to 52 %, wind speed increased from 8.4 m/s to 12.3 m/s, and surface pressure dropped slightly from 996.1 hPa to 994.2 hPa. Most importantly, direct solar radiation was around 430 W/m² at 03:30 UTC – a typical daytime value for the region, far above the 0 W/m² reported by the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 sensor.

No other sensor readings in the weather dataset indicate anomalies at that time; all parameters are within expected ranges and follow normal diurnal trends. Since the external weather conditions were clearly sunny, the zero‑radiation reading is almost certainly a sensor‑specific fault rather than a true atmospheric event.

**Potential common cause assessment:**
- The solar radiation sensor likely suffered a power loss, shading, or internal failure. Because the other measured variables (temperature, humidity, wind, pressure) appear normal, a shared power or data‑logger issue seems unlikely, or at least it did not affect the other sensors. 
- If the radiation sensor shares the same logger or power supply, a transient glitch could have isolated the sensor output while leaving other channels intact. 
- Environmental factors such as sudden dust deposition, water ingress, or a mis‑aligned dome could also produce a zero reading without impacting other sensors.

**Conclusion:** No additional sensor anomalies are evident in the available data around the event time, suggesting the solar radiation issue is isolated. The most plausible explanation is a sensor‑specific malfunction (e.g., power interruption, shading, or hardware failure) rather than a broader system‑wide problem.

**Recommendation:** Perform a visual inspection of the CMP3 unit for obstruction or damage, verify power and data‑logger connections, and consider recalibrating or replacing the sensor if the zero‑reading persists.
