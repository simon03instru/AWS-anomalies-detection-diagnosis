**Current weather (satellite‑derived) around the detection time (2024‑08‑19T07:40Z)**\n- Temperature: ~28.9 °C (29.0 °C at 07:30 Z, 28.8 °C at 07:45 Z)\n- Relative humidity: ~58.5 % (58 % at 07:30 Z, 59 % at 07:45 Z)\n- Precipitation: 0 mm (dry conditions)\n- Windspeed (10 m): ~20 m s⁻¹ (steady)\n- Surface pressure: ~993.7 hPa\n\n**Comparison with the anomalous sensor reading**\n- Reported temperature: 13.0 °C – more than 15 °C lower than the ambient temperature indicated by the model.\n- Reported humidity: 49.1 % – about 9 % lower than the expected ~58 % humidity.\nThe discrepancy is far beyond normal sensor tolerance (±0.5 °C, ±2 % RH for Vaisala HMP155) and matches the trend analysis that flagged a ~17.5 °C deviation (≈3 σ).\n\n**Operational range & sensor suitability**\n- Vaisala HMP155 operates from –40 °C to +60 °C and 0–100 % RH, so the observed ambient conditions (≈29 °C, 58 % RH) are well within its range. The sensor’s accuracy (±0.5 °C, ±2 % RH) would not accommodate a 15 °C temperature error, confirming a likely malfunction rather than an out‑of‑range situation.\n\n**Possible causes & troubleshooting**\n1. **Sensor drift or electronic fault** – a sudden offset of ~15 °C suggests a calibration loss or internal circuit failure.\n2. **Moisture ingress or condensation** – could affect the temperature probe, especially if the housing seal is compromised.\n3. **Power supply instability** – voltage spikes can corrupt readings.\n4. **Firmware/communication error** – check data logger logs for checksum failures around the event time.\n\n**Recommended actions**\n- **Immediate**: Flag the sensor as faulty and exclude its data from any operational decisions. Replace or recalibrate the temperature probe.\n- **Inspect**: Verify the sensor housing for water ingress, corrosion, and proper sealing.\n- **Check power & data logger**: Measure supply voltage stability and review communication logs for errors.\n- **Calibration check**: Perform an on‑site calibration against a reference thermometer and hygrometer.\n- **Documentation**: Record the incident, update maintenance logs, and schedule a routine preventive check for the remaining sensors (humidity, wind, pressure) to ensure they are still reliable.\n\n**Overall assessment**\nThe satellite‑derived weather data shows normal tropical conditions (≈29 °C, 58 % RH, no rain) at the time of the anomaly. The sensor’s reported temperature of 13 °C and lower humidity are inconsistent with both the ambient environment and the sensor’s specified accuracy, indicating a clear sensor fault. Following the above troubleshooting and replacement steps should restore reliable measurements and prevent future false‑positive anomaly alerts.

The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor operates over a temperature range of –80 °C to +60 °C. Its sensitivity (accuracy) is expressed as ±(0.226 – 0.0028 × T) °C for temperatures between –80 °C and +20 °C, and ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × T) °C for temperatures between +20 °C and +60 °C. The reported anomalous reading of 13.0 °C is well within the sensor’s operational range. Using the accuracy formula for the 13 °C temperature (which falls in the +20 °C to +60 °C bracket, but since 13 °C is below 20 °C we apply the lower‑range formula), the expected error margin is ±(0.226 – 0.0028 × 13) ≈ ±0.19 °C. The observed deviation of ~17.5 °C far exceeds this expected error, indicating the reading is not within the sensor’s normal sensitivity limits and likely reflects a sensor fault.

Possible causes for the low‑temperature anomaly in a Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor include:
• Contamination or fouling of the sensor element (e.g., dust, moisture, or chemical deposits) that impairs heat transfer.
• Inadequate or unstable power supply to the sensor, causing erroneous output.
• Faulty wiring or connector issues leading to intermittent signal loss.
• Communication problems with the data logger or controller (e.g., corrupted data packets).
• Sensor aging or degradation of the thermistor element.

Recommended maintenance actions:
1. Visually inspect the sensor housing for dirt, debris, or moisture; clean the sensor element with a soft brush or approved cleaning solvent.
2. Verify power voltage and continuity of wiring; tighten or replace connectors as needed.
3. Check data‑logger communication settings and cables; replace faulty cables.
4. Perform a full calibration of the temperature sensor according to Vaisala calibration procedures (typically annually or after any cleaning/replacement).
5. If cleaning and calibration do not resolve the low‑temperature fault, replace the sensor unit.
6. Document the maintenance actions, sensor ID, and date of service for future reference.

**Comprehensive Assessment**

1. **Weather Context (2024‑08‑19 07:40 UTC / 14:40 UTC+7)**
   - Satellite‑derived temperature: ~28.9 °C (≈29 °C)
   - Relative humidity: ~58 %
   - Precipitation: 0 mm (dry)
   - Windspeed (10 m): ~20 m s⁻¹
   - Surface pressure: ~993.7 hPa
   The ambient conditions were typical for tropical Yogyakarta – warm, humid, and windy.

2. **Sensor Specification & Deviation**
   - **Sensor**: Vaisala HMP155 (temperature & humidity)
   - **Operational range**: –80 °C to +60 °C (well within the observed ~29 °C)
   - **Accuracy at 13 °C**: ±0.19 °C (using the –80 °C to +20 °C formula)
   - **Observed reading**: 13.0 °C (≈15 °C lower than ambient) and RH 49.1 % (≈9 % lower than ambient)
   - **Deviation**: ~17.5 °C from the 10‑minute mean, far exceeding the ±0.5 °C typical tolerance and the sensor’s stated accuracy. This confirms a sensor fault rather than an out‑of‑range condition.

3. **Maintenance & Troubleshooting Findings**
   - **Likely causes**:
     • Contamination or moisture ingress affecting the thermistor probe.
     • Unstable or incorrect power supply to the sensor.
     • Faulty wiring/connector or intermittent signal loss.
     • Data‑logger communication errors (checksum failures, corrupted packets).
     • Age‑related degradation of the sensor element.
   - **Recommended actions**:
     1. **Immediate data handling** – Flag the temperature sensor as faulty, exclude its data from operational decisions, and issue an alert to the station operator.
     2. **Physical inspection** – Check the sensor housing for water ingress, dust, or corrosion; clean the probe with a soft brush and approved solvent.
     3. **Electrical check** – Verify supply voltage stability, continuity of wiring, and connector integrity; replace any damaged cables.
     4. **Communication review** – Examine data‑logger logs around 07:40 UTC for checksum or transmission errors; reset/re‑configure the logger if needed.
     5. **Calibration** – Perform an on‑site calibration against a certified reference thermometer and hygrometer. If calibration cannot correct the offset, replace the HMP155 unit.
     6. **Documentation** – Record the incident, sensor serial number, maintenance steps taken, and update the preventive‑maintenance schedule.
     7. **Preventive measures** – Schedule routine inspections of all AWS sensors (humidity, wind, pressure) and verify that protective enclosures remain sealed, especially during the rainy season.

**Actionable Recommendations for the Station Operator**
- Mark the temperature reading as invalid for the period surrounding 2024‑08‑19 07:40 UTC.
- Deploy a replacement Vaisala HMP155 (or calibrated spare) within the next maintenance window.
- Conduct the inspection, power‑check, and communication audit outlined above before reinstalling the sensor.
- After replacement/calibration, run a verification period (e.g., 30 min) comparing sensor output to satellite‑derived values to confirm proper operation.
- Update the station’s maintenance log and incorporate a quarterly sensor‑health review to catch similar faults early.

Overall, the satellite‑derived weather data shows normal tropical conditions, while the sensor’s anomalous low temperature and humidity readings are inconsistent with both the environment and the sensor’s specifications, indicating a clear malfunction. Following the above troubleshooting and replacement steps will restore reliable measurements and reduce false‑positive anomaly alerts.
