**Assessment**
- The satellite‑derived weather at the time of the event (2024‑08‑16 15:30 UTC, local night) was ~12 °C temperature, 0 W/m² solar radiation, 88 % RH and 22 m s⁻¹ wind. The reported sensor values (2.96 °C and 1000 W/m²) are far outside the ambient conditions, confirming the anomalies identified by the trend analysis.
- The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor is operating well within its –80 °C to +60 °C range, but the reading is ~9 °C low, suggesting a sensor‑stuck or calibration error rather than a true extreme. The known low‑temperature bias below –40 °C does not apply here.
- The Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer also operates within its 0‑2000 W/m² range, yet it reports a full‑daylight value at night, a classic false‑positive failure mode for this model.

**Possible Common Cause**
- Both sensors share the same data‑logger and power feed. A transient power‑supply glitch, grounding issue, or data‑logger firmware fault could corrupt analog‑to‑digital conversion, causing the temperature sensor to read low and the pyranometer to output a default daylight voltage. Wiring faults (loose connectors, corrosion) could produce similar simultaneous errors.

**Actionable Recommendations**
*Immediate Verification*:
1. Inspect and reseat all sensor cables, connectors, and the data‑logger power supply; measure supply voltage stability.
2. Perform a quick on‑site calibration check of the HMP155 (use the built‑in calibration routine or a reference thermometer) and verify the CMP3 output voltage against a known dark condition.
3. Swap the HMP155 and CMP3 with known‑good spare units, if available, to see if the anomalies persist.
4. Cross‑check the current readings with the nearest AWS or nearby reference station to confirm ambient conditions.
5. Flag the 2024‑08‑16 15:30 UTC timestamp in the data stream and exclude it from analyses until the issue is resolved.

*Long‑Term Mitigation*:
1. Implement automated QC rules that trigger alerts when temperature deviates >5 °C from nearby stations or when solar radiation >0 W/m² during night hours.
2. Schedule regular (quarterly) visual inspections of sensor housings, wiring, and power supplies, and annual recalibration of both sensors per manufacturer guidance.
3. Maintain a spare HMP155 and CMP3 on‑site for rapid replacement.
4. Log all incidents in the maintenance database and track recurring power‑supply or data‑logger faults; consider upgrading to a redundant data‑logger or isolated power modules if failures repeat.
5. Document the troubleshooting steps taken and update SOPs to include the specific checks for simultaneous temperature‑low and solar‑radiation‑high anomalies.

By addressing the immediate wiring/power‑supply checks and establishing robust QC and maintenance practices, the likelihood of repeat anomalies can be substantially reduced.
