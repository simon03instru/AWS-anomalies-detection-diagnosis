  1. The Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor has an operational humidity range from 0% to 100% relative humidity. The accuracy is typically within ±2% of the measurement range, and the sensitivity is generally about 0.1% relative humidity.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor has an operational humidity range of 0 to 100 %RH. Its accuracy includes: ±1 %RH (0 … 90 %RH) and ±1.7 %RH (90 … 100 %RH) at temperatures between +15 to +25 °C. Sensitivity is detailed as part of its calibration: ±(1.0 + 0.008 × reading) %RH for temperatures between −20 to +40 °C, and ±(1.2 + 0.012 × reading) %RH for other specified ranges.


  1. To troubleshoot implausible humidity readings (e.g., -9999, NAN, 0%) in the Vaisala HMP155, follow these steps:

1. **Check Wiring**: Ensure that the sensor is connected to the correct analog input channels.
2. **Verify Measurements**: Confirm that the range code matches the data logger type and that the red power wire is connected to a 12V source.
3. **Check Output Voltage**: Use a voltmeter to check the output voltages for temperature and relative humidity.

If readings are still incorrect:
- Inspect for contaminants on the sensor and probe filter, and clean or replace them as necessary.
- Ensure the sensor has been properly calibrated, and recalibrate annually.
- Verify sensor communications if readings remain unstable. Clean debris from the radiation shield and ensure that it is functioning properly.

  2. To troubleshoot zero humidity and implausible humidity readings with the Vaisala HMP155, consider the following steps:

1. **Cleaning**: Ensure that the sintered Teflon filter is clean and free from dirt and moisture, as a clogged filter can affect readings.

2. **Calibration**: Verify the calibration of the HMP155 using a USB connection or the MI70 indicator. Factory calibration uncertainty is ±0.6 %RH (0 ... 40 %RH) and ±1.0 %RH (40 ... 95 %RH).

3. **Check the Environment**: Ensure that the probe is not exposed to conditions that could saturate the humidity measurement, such as fog or heavy dew, since the warmed probe mitigates these issues.

4. **Inspect the Probe**: If the probe has been in use for an extended period, check for signs of wear or damage. It may need replacement if it does not provide accurate readings.

5. **Connections**: Ensure all connections are secure and that the operating voltage is within the correct range (7 ... 28 V DC).

If problems persist after these checks, consider contacting Vaisala support for further assistance.
