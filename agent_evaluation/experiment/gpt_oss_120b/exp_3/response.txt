**Comprehensive Assessment of the Relative Humidity Anomaly (2024‑08‑15 20:00 UTC)**

1. **Current weather conditions (satellite‑derived)**
   - Temperature: ~20.5 °C
   - Relative humidity: ~86 % (typical night‑time value for Yogyakarta)
   - Wind speed: ~5.7 m s⁻¹ from 325° (NNW)
   - These conditions are far from the reported 0 % RH reading. The discrepancy (>80 % absolute error) confirms that the sensor output does not reflect the actual atmosphere.

2. **Sensor specifications (Vaisala HMP155)**
   - Measurement range: 0 %–100 % RH (so a 0 % reading is technically within the range).
   - Accuracy: ±0.6 % RH (0‑40 % RH) and ±1.0 % RH (40‑95 % RH).
   - Response time: 20 s to 63 % step, 60 s to 90 % step at +20 °C.
   - While a 0 % value is allowed by the spec, the sensor’s accuracy and the physical impossibility of 0 % RH under the observed conditions indicate a malfunction rather than a true measurement.

3. **Troubleshooting guidance for a zero‑percent reading**
   - Verify wiring and 12 V power to the sensor.
   - Measure output voltages on the temperature (yellow) and humidity (blue) wires.
   - Inspect and clean the sintered‑Teflon filter and O‑ring; replace the filter if clogged.
   - Ensure the sensor element is seated correctly and free of corrosion or moisture.
   - Perform a calibration using the USB/MI70 interface; recalibrate if needed.
   - Conduct routine maintenance: clean the probe, check the radiation shield, confirm installation environment is within the sensor’s operating limits (‑80 °C to +60 °C, 0‑100 % RH).
   - If the zero‑percent reading persists after cleaning and calibration, replace the sensor element or the entire probe.

4. **Assessment with trend analysis**
   - The trend analysis flagged a “physically impossible” 0 % RH reading with >95 % confidence of sensor fault.
   - The satellite data and typical night‑time climatology (~70‑80 % RH) strongly support this conclusion.
   - No other anomalies (temperature, wind, pressure) were reported, so the issue appears isolated to the humidity sensor.

5. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - **Immediate**: Flag the HMP155 sensor as faulty in the station’s data‑quality log. Stop using its humidity values for any operational decisions until the issue is resolved.
   - **Short‑term** (within 1‑2 days):
     * Inspect wiring and power connections.
     * Clean the probe filter and O‑ring.
     * Perform an on‑site calibration check; record the output voltage.
   - **If the zero reading persists**: Replace the HMP155 sensor (or at least the humidity probe) with a calibrated unit.
   - **Cross‑validation**: Compare future humidity readings with a nearby official BMKG station or another reliable AWS to verify sensor performance.
   - **Documentation**: Log the incident, include the satellite‑derived humidity (~86 %) as the reference, and schedule the sensor for the next routine maintenance cycle.
   - **Long‑term**: Consider adding a secondary humidity sensor (different brand) for redundancy, especially if the station is used for critical applications.

**Conclusion**: The 0 % RH reading is a clear sensor fault, not an atmospheric event. Following the above troubleshooting steps and, if necessary, sensor replacement will restore reliable humidity monitoring at AWS_DIY_UGM.
