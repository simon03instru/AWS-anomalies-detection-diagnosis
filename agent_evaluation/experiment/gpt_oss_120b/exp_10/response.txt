**Assessment**: The 100 mm rainfall spike recorded at 2024‑08‑15 20:00 local (13:00 UTC) is inconsistent with satellite‑derived weather data, which show 0 mm precipitation, stable temperature (23.4 °C), pressure (995.7 hPa) and humidity (75 %). No concurrent atmospheric changes were observed, confirming the trend analysis that the HYQUEST TB4 rain gauge most likely malfunctioned.

**Most Likely Cause**: A false high‑rainfall spike caused by a mechanical or debris issue in the tipping‑bucket mechanism (e.g., blockage, sticking bucket, or wiring/calibration mismatch). Although the reading (600 mm h⁻¹) is within the sensor’s maximum range (700 mm h⁻¹), the lack of any real rain makes a sensor fault the dominant explanation.

**Actionable Recommendations**:
1. **Visual & Mechanical Inspection** – Check the funnel, catch filter, and interior of the TB4 for leaves, bird droppings, sediment, or other debris; ensure the bucket tips freely.
2. **Clean the Gauge** – Remove any blockage, rinse the funnel, and verify that the siphon is unobstructed.
3. **Verify Wiring & Logger Settings** – Confirm correct terminal connections and that the data logger’s pulse‑count parameters match the TB4 specifications.
4. **Calibration Check** – Perform a field calibration using Hyquest’s Portable Field Calibration Device (or a known‑volume water test) and update firmware if needed.
5. **Cross‑Check Data** – If possible, enable the TB4’s dual‑output to a second logger or install a backup rain sensor for redundancy.
6. **Replace if Necessary** – Should the false spikes persist after cleaning and recalibration, replace the rain gauge.
7. **Post‑Maintenance Monitoring** – Log the next 24 h of rainfall data alongside satellite observations to confirm normal operation.

By following these steps the station can quickly resolve the false spike, restore reliable precipitation measurements, and prevent future data quality issues.
