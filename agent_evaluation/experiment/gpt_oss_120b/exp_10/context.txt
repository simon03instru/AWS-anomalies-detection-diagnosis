  1. The specific measurement range, resolution, and recommended sampling interval for the HYQUEST TB4 rainfall sensor are not detailed in the provided context.

  2. The HyQuest TB4 rainfall sensor has a measurement range of up to 700 mm per hour, a resolution of 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, and 0.01 inch. The recommended sampling interval is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.



  1. To troubleshoot false high rainfall spikes in the Hyquest TB4 tipping bucket rain gauge, follow these steps: 1. Ensure the sensor is properly wired to the designated terminals and calibrate settings (PulseCount() parameters) are correct for your data logger. 2. Check for any debris or sediment in the collection funnel and tipping bucket assembly that could affect measurements. 3. Clean and maintain the catch filter, siphon, and interior of the bucket regularly. 4. Perform a calibration check once a year. If problems persist, consult Hyquest Solutions for assistance.

  2. To troubleshoot false high rainfall spikes in the HyQuest TB4 tipping bucket rain gauge, consider the following steps:

1. **Maintenance Check**: Ensure the collector catch area is free from debris like leaves or bird droppings which could block the funnel and cause erroneous readings. Use the finger filter for easier access during field service.
2. **Calibration**: Run field calibrations using the Portable Field Calibration Device (FCD) to ensure the gauge is accurately measuring rainfall. The FCD allows for functional tests without dismantling the gauge.
3. **Check for Environmental Factors**: Examine whether environmental conditions, such as high winds or nearby structures, might be affecting the readings.
4. **Inspect the Mechanism**: Examine the tipping bucket mechanism for any mechanical issues that could lead to inaccurate readings or malfunction.
5. **Data Verification**: Utilize the dual output features of the TB4 to cross-verify data with a second data logger to determine if readings are consistent.
