  1. The Vaisala PTB110 atmospheric pressure sensor does not require regular maintenance and contains no replaceable parts. Specific measurement range and typical operating conditions are not mentioned in the provided context.

  2. The Vaisala PTB110 atmospheric pressure sensor has a specific pressure measurement range and operates under certain humidity conditions. For detailed specifications, including the exact measurement range and typical operating conditions, please refer to the product documentation, as the available context does not provide those specifics.



  1. For issues with the Vaisala PTB110 leading to invalid sentinel values or communication failures, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Sensor Connection**: Ensure the sensor card is fully inserted in its socket and in the correct orientation.
2. **Verify Power Supply**: Check that the white wire is properly connected to the specified terminal and that the red wire is connected to a 12V terminal.
3. **Test Voltage**: Use a digital voltmeter to confirm 12V is reaching the sensor. If connected to a switched 12V terminal, test with a non-switched terminal.
4. **Address Verification**: Ensure the BaroVUE 10 SDI-12 address matches what is entered in the SDI12Recorder() instruction.
5. **Calibration Needs**: Regularly check calibration; recalibrate if measurements are unreliable.

  2. To troubleshoot communication failures and invalid sentinel values with the Vaisala PTB110 (and similar models like PTB210), consider the following known issues:

1. **Operating Environment**: Ensure that the device is operating in the specified conditions, particularly under the non-condensing operating humidity to prevent moisture issues.

2. **Verify Connections**: Check all electrical connections for proper installation and secure mounting.

3. **Power Supply**: Confirm that the power supply voltage is within the required range (5-28 VDC for RS-232/TTL or 8-18 VDC for RS-485/analog) and is not reversed.

4. **Serial Communication Settings**: Ensure that serial communication settings (baud rate, data bits, stop bits, parity) are correctly configured to match both the PTB110 and the connected device.

5. **Calibration Check**: If the pressure reading is erratic or invalid, perform calibration checks as per Vaisala's guidelines to ensure accuracy.

6. **Firmware Updates**: Ensure the firmware is up to date as communication protocols may change over time. 

If issues persist, refer to the Vaisala technical support for further assistance.
