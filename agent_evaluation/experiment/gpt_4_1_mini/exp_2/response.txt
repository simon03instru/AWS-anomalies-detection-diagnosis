Comprehensive Assessment Report on Atmospheric Pressure Sensor Anomaly at AWS_DIY_UGM (UGM Yogyakarta)

1. Weather Context:
- On 2024-08-15 at 20:00 UTC, the actual surface pressure measured near the station was approximately 995.0 hPa, with typical weather conditions including temperature around 20.5°C, relative humidity at 86%, and moderate wind speeds (~5.7 m/s). These values are physically plausible and consistent with expected atmospheric conditions for the location and time.
- The anomalous sensor reading of -9999.0 hPa is a sentinel value indicating an invalid measurement, far outside any physically possible atmospheric pressure range.

2. Sensor Specifications and Operational Range:
- The Vaisala PTB110 sensor used at the station has a high sensitivity of 0.05 hPa and is designed to measure atmospheric pressure within a typical range of roughly 300 to 1100 hPa.
- The reported value of -9999.0 hPa is well beyond the sensor's operational range and is recognized as an error code rather than a valid measurement.

3. Maintenance and Troubleshooting Insights:
- Common causes for such invalid sentinel values include sensor card defects, improper installation, electrical issues, or environmental factors such as excessive humidity.
- Recommended troubleshooting steps include verifying sensor card installation and connections, checking sensor orientation, replacing desiccants to control humidity, and performing calibration using internal controls or factory reset procedures.
- If issues persist after these steps, replacing the sensor card with proper anti-static handling is advised.
- Regular maintenance should include connection inspections, recalibrations, and physical checks for damage or wear.
- Consulting Vaisala technical support is recommended for unresolved faults.

4. Trend Analysis and Correlation:
- The anomaly shows a broken correlation with wind speed and a deviation exceeding 1000 times the typical pressure range, strongly indicating sensor communication failure or hardware malfunction.
- No other anomalies were reported, suggesting this is an isolated sensor issue rather than a systemic weather event.

5. Actionable Recommendations:
- Immediately schedule a physical inspection of the Vaisala PTB110 sensor at AWS_DIY_UGM.
- Perform the recommended troubleshooting steps: check connections, sensor card seating, orientation, and environmental conditions.
- Conduct sensor calibration or factory reset to attempt restoring valid readings.
- Replace the sensor card if faults persist after troubleshooting.
- Implement a routine maintenance schedule to prevent recurrence, including regular calibration and environmental control measures.
- Document all maintenance actions and monitor sensor output closely post-intervention.

Summary:
The atmospheric pressure anomaly at AWS_DIY_UGM is conclusively due to sensor communication failure or hardware fault, not actual weather conditions. Prompt maintenance and possible sensor replacement are necessary to restore reliable atmospheric pressure data at the station.
