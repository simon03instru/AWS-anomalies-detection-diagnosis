  2. For troubleshooting calibration errors and sensor issues with the Vaisala HMP155 and Kipp & Zonen CMP3:

1. **HMP155 Calibration Error (Vaisala HUMICAPâ 180R sensor):** Ensure the probe is properly calibrated using a USB connection, push buttons, or through the MI70 indicator. For humidity measurements, verify that the sensor is not affected by condensation or humidity saturation. A warmed probe may be necessary in high-humidity environments to ensure accurate readings. Regular calibration and maintenance are crucial for long-term stability.

2. **CMP3 Calibration Error:** Refer to Kipp & Zonen's documentation for specific calibration procedures or troubleshooting tips, as details for the CMP3 were not provided in the context. Generally, check for environmental factors, probe cleanliness, and proper connections as foundational checks.

  1. The Vaisala HMP155 has a low-temperature bias regarding its operational temperature range accuracy, while the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer can experience false positives in its solar radiation measurements at night.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 has an operational temperature range of −80 to +60 °C (−112 to +140 °F) with an accuracy of ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × temperature) °C at −80 to +20 °C and ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × temperature) °C at +20 to +60 °C. Its low temperature bias can result in inaccuracies, especially below −40 °C.

For the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 solar radiation sensor, there is a risk of night-time false positives when measuring solar radiation in the absence of sunlight or artificial light sources, which could lead to erroneous readings.


  1. For the Vaisala HMP155, if temperature readings are stuck low, check for any wiring issues or sensor malfunctions. This sensor may also require recalibration if readings are consistently faulty.

For the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer showing high solar radiation at night, inspect the outer dome for ice or dew, as this can artificially increase readings. Ensure the sensor is clean and calibrate it if it has drifted over time. Regular maintenance, including checking sensor connections and cable conditions, is vital.

  2. For the Vaisala HMP155 stuck low temperature readings, ensure that the probe is not affected by environmental factors such as condensation, which can impact its measured temperature. You may also want to check if the probe is properly calibrated and the sensor is functioning correctly within its operating limits (-80 to +60 °C). The use of an appropriate Stevenson screen can help in protecting the probe from radiation and precipitation, thus improving measurement accuracy.

Regarding the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 measuring high solar radiation at night, the problem may stem from a malfunctioning sensor, or it could be incorrectly picking up stray light or reflections. Ensure that the sensor is properly installed and is free from dust or obstructions. If ongoing issues persist, consider servicing or replacing the device, as the CMP3 lacks advanced features like temperature correction found in higher models such as CMP6.

  1. ### Troubleshooting Guide for Kipp & Zonen CMP3 Solar Radiation Sensor:

**Common Failure Modes:**  
1. **Unusually High Readings at Night:**  
   - On clear, windless nights, the outer dome temperature may drop significantly, causing dew or frost to form on the dome, which can create false high readings due to enhanced diffusion of solar radiation.
   - Icing on the dome can increase the pyranometer signal by up to 50% after sunrise.

2. **Symptom: –9999 or Radiation Values Around 0:**  
   - Ensure correct wiring and measurement range for the data logger.
   - Measure impedance across sensor wires; low resistance may indicate a short circuit.

3. **Symptom: Unreasonably High or Low Signal:**  
   - Confirm the correct calibration factor is entered into the data logger.
   - Inspect the condition of the sensor cable.

4. **Unexpected Variations in Signal:**  
   - Check for strong electromagnetic sources interfering with measurements.
   - Inspect the sensor shield wire and cable connections.

### Recommended Maintenance Actions:
- **Daily/Weekly:** Inspect and clean the sensor dome to remove dirt, dust, or ice accumulation. Ensure there is no moisture inside the dome.
