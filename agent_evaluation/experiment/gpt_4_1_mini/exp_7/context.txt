  1. The HMP155 temperature sensor utilizes a Pt100 temperature sensor that is soldered to the probe. However, specific operational temperature range and sensitivity specifications for the HMP155 are not mentioned in the provided context.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor has an operational temperature range of -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F). Its sensitivity specifications include an accuracy of ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × temperature) °C for the range of -80 to +20 °C and ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × temperature) °C for the range of +20 to +60 °C, along with a fast response time of < 20 seconds for 63% and < 35 seconds for 90% in 3 m/s air flow.

  1. ### Troubleshooting Guides for Vaisala HMP155 Temperature Sensor

#### Common Failure Modes:
1. **Anomalous Readings:**
   - **Symptoms:**  Relative Humidity reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%.
     - **Causes:** Incorrect wiring, wrong range code, power issues.
     - **Recommendations:** Ensure the sensor is correctly wired; verify range code and power connection; check output voltage using a voltmeter.
   - **Symptoms:** Incorrect temperature or humidity readings.
     - **Causes:** Incorrect multiplier or offset parameters.
     - **Recommendations:** Check and verify data logger programming settings.
2. **Communication Issues:**
   - **Symptoms:** Temperature reported as –9999 or NAN.
     - **Causes:** Problems with SDI-12 communications.
     - **Recommendations:** Recheck sensor wiring and voltage supply to the sensor.

### Recommended Maintenance Procedures:
1. **Monthly Maintenance:** 
   - Inspect the radiation shield for debris.
   - Check the probe tip for contaminants.
2. **Annual Maintenance:** 
   - Change the probe filter (especially in polluted environments).
   - Recalibrate the sensor as needed (factory recalibration is recommended once a year).
   - Ensure proper cleaning with mild detergent and a soft cloth.
   - If salt buildup occurs near bodies of salt water, clean the filter and chip carefully with distilled water.

### Conclusion:
Proper troubleshooting can resolve sensor anomalies, while regular maintenance ensures accuracy and extends the lifespan of the HMP155 temperature sensor.

  2. ### Troubleshooting Guides for Vaisala HMP155 Temperature Sensor
1. **Anomalous Readings**: Common causes include:
   - Condensation on the sensor due to high humidity levels (fog, mist, rain).
   - Probe contamination from dust or dirt blocking measurements.
   - Incorrect calibration or faulty electronics.

2. **Resolution Steps**:
   - Ensure the warmed probe is functioning to prevent condensation.
   - Regularly clean the sintered Teflon filter to maintain measurement accuracy. 
   - Verify calibration and check for updates using the USB connection.

### Common Failure Modes
- **Sensor Drift**: Loss of accuracy over time due to environmental factors.
- **Electrical Failures**: Failures due to improper voltage supply or damaged cables.
- **Physical Damage**: Damage to the probe or housing from severe weather or impacts.

### Recommended Maintenance Procedures
1. **Regular Calibration**: Calibrate the sensor using a computer or the MI70 indicator.
2. **Cleaning**: Clean the membrane filter regularly and inspect for dust or dirt.
3. **Environmental Protection**: Install in a suitable shielding (like DTR503 or Stevenson screen) to protect from direct solar radiation and precipitation.
4. **Visual Inspections**: Conduct regular checks for physical and electrical integrity.

By following these guidelines, the performance and reliability of the HMP155 sensor can be maintained.
