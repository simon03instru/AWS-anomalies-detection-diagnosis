The analysis of the temperature anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA reveals a significant sensor malfunction. 
The anomalous temperature reading of 13.0°C is approximately 17.5°C below the 10-minute mean temperature (~30.6°C) and exceeds a 3σ deviation, 
indicating a highly unlikely environmental condition. Current weather data at the location and time (2024-08-19 14:40 local) show a temperature around 28.8 to 29.0°C, 
relative humidity near 58-59%, no precipitation, and normal wind and pressure conditions, confirming the anomaly is not meteorological but sensor-related. 
The Vaisala HMP155 sensor used has an operational range from -80 to +60°C and sufficient sensitivity to detect such temperature changes, 
so the reading is within sensor range but inconsistent with actual conditions. Common failure modes for this sensor include wiring or power issues, contamination, calibration drift, 
and environmental factors such as condensation or dirt on the probe. The lack of expected negative correlation between temperature and humidity further supports sensor malfunction rather than environmental cause. Recommended actions to resolve the anomaly include: 1) Inspect and verify sensor wiring and power supply integrity; 2) Clean the sensor probe and radiation shield to remove any contaminants or debris; 3) Recalibrate the sensor, preferably with factory calibration annually; 4) Ensure proper installation with adequate shielding from direct solar radiation and precipitation; 5) Conduct regular maintenance checks including filter replacement and membrane cleaning. These steps should restore accurate temperature readings and prevent recurrence of similar anomalies. 
No other anomalies were detected, indicating this is an isolated sensor fault rather than systemic issues.
