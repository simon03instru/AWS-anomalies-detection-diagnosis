  1. To troubleshoot abrupt temperature deviation and loss of correlation with humidity in the Vaisala HMP155:

1. **Check Wiring**: Ensure the sensor is wired correctly to the analog input channels specified in the measurement instructions.

2. **Verify Power Supply**: Confirm the red power wire is correctly connected to the appropriate 12V or SW12V channel. Test the output voltage on the yellow and blue wires to check for temperature and humidity accuracy.

3. **Inspect Sensor Element**: Ensure the sensor element is properly plugged in and oriented, with no water or corrosion present under the connector.

4. **Clean Filter and Sensor**: If the filter is contaminated, clean it with distilled water or replace it if necessary. Regularly check for dust, debris, or salt buildup on the sensor and filter, especially when near saltwater.

5. **Recalibrate Annually**: Have the HMP155A recalibrated at least annually to maintain accuracy.

  2. To troubleshoot abrupt temperature deviation and loss of correlation with humidity in the Vaisala HMP155 probe, check the following:

1. **Warming of the Probe**: Ensure that the warmed probe is functioning correctly, as it helps maintain accurate humidity measurements, especially in saturated environments. A failure in heating may lead to inaccurate readings.

2. **Condensation Issues**: If condensation forms on the probe, it can cause errors in measurement. The probe should be continuously warmed to prevent this.

3. **Calibration**: Verify that the HMP155 has been properly calibrated. Improper calibration can lead to deviations in both temperature and humidity measurements.

4. **Environmental Factors**: Consider the surrounding conditions such as fog, rain, and heavy dew which can impact measurements. Ensure it's installed in an appropriate radiation shield (DTR503, DTR13, or Stevenson screen) to minimize environmental exposure.

5. **Mechanical Issues**: Inspect the probe and its connections for any damage or wiring issues that could affect its performance.

By following these steps, you may be able to identify the cause of the abrupt temperature deviation and restore proper function.

  1. For troubleshooting abrupt temperature spikes in the Vaisala HMP155, follow these steps:

1. **Check Wiring**: Ensure the sensor is wired correctly to the analog input channels.
2. **Verify Range Code**: Confirm that the range code matches the data logger type.
3. **Power Supply**: Make sure the red power wire is connected to the appropriate 12V channel. During troubleshooting, connect it directly to a 12V terminal to test.
4. **Output Voltage Check**: Use a voltmeter to measure the output voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires.
5. **Recalibrate**: Recalibrate the sensor annually to maintain accuracy, especially if used in polluted or saline environments.
6. **Sensor Condition**: Inspect the probe filter and radiation shield for contamination or salt buildup, which can interfere with measurements.

  2. To troubleshoot abrupt temperature spikes in the Vaisala HMP155, consider the following maintenance steps:

1. **Check the installation environment**: Ensure that the probe is not directly exposed to elements that could cause rapid temperature changes, such as sunlight or precipitation. Use appropriate radiation shields (DTR13, DTR503, or Stevenson screen).

2. **Inspect the sensor for dirt or obstructions**: The sintered Teflon filter provides protection, but it can still be obstructed by dirt or moisture, causing inaccurate readings.

3. **Ensure proper calibration**: Verify that the HMP155 is properly calibrated using USB connection or MI70 indicator, and check for any signs of calibration drift.

4. **Examine the warmed probe functionality**: If the probe is used in high humidity environments, confirm that the warming feature is operational, as it helps to prevent condensation formation on the sensor.

5. **Review power supply**: Ensure that the operating voltage is within specified limits (7–28 V DC) to maintain proper sensor function.

6. **Test response times**: Check the specified response times of the temperature probe under operational conditions; delays in response can lead to apparent 'spikes' in temperature readings.

7. **Consult official documentation**: Review the technical datasheet for any specific troubleshooting recommendations provided by Vaisala.


  1. Common causes for the issues mentioned (wind direction anomaly, sensor communication failure, and temperature anomaly) typically include:
1. **Invalid Data**: This can occur due to errors in sensor readings such as sentinel values like -9999 or other codes indicating unusable data.
2. **Sensor Malfunction**: This includes problems with the sensor itself (e.g., calibration issues, internal errors). 
3. **Missing Sensor**: If a sensor is physically absent, it will not provide data, leading to anomalies. 
4. **Communication Issues**: Failures in data transmission can result in incomplete or erroneous data being recorded.
5. **Power Issues**: Insufficient power supply might affect sensor performance leading to communication failures.

In summary, anomalies such as a 13°C drop in temperature could be attributed to either the sensor being malfunctioning or an absent sensor rather than issues with calibration.
