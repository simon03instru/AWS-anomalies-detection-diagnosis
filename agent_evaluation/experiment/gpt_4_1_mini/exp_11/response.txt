The atmospheric pressure anomaly detected at AWS_DIY_UGM on 2024-08-15T20:10:00 is characterized by an invalid sentinel value of -9999.0 hPa, which is far outside the normal operational range of the Vaisala PTB110 sensor (approximately 995-996 hPa for the location and time). This value clearly indicates a sensor communication failure or a dead pressure sensor rather than a true atmospheric pressure measurement. Current weather data for the location around the anomaly time shows normal surface pressure readings near 995 hPa, confirming the anomaly is not meteorological but sensor-related.

The Vaisala PTB110 sensor is designed for reliable atmospheric pressure measurement within typical environmental ranges and does not support or produce values like -9999.0 hPa. The sensor requires no regular maintenance and has no replaceable parts, but troubleshooting steps include verifying sensor card insertion, wiring connections, and power supply voltage. Resetting the sensor to factory settings and recalibration using the NIST traceable calibration certificate are recommended if issues persist. Ultimately, if the fault remains unresolved, sensor replacement is advised.

No other anomalies were detected at the station, and no correlations with other parameters could be established due to the sensor fault. The anomaly is isolated to the pressure sensor failure.

Actionable Recommendations:
1. Perform immediate physical inspection of the Vaisala PTB110 sensor card and wiring connections to ensure proper installation and no damage.
2. Verify the sensor power supply voltage with a digital voltmeter, ensuring stable and correct voltage.
3. Attempt a factory reset of the sensor and check for recovery of valid pressure readings.
4. If the sensor continues to report invalid values, arrange for recalibration or replacement of the sensor card.
5. Implement routine checks to monitor sensor communication status to detect similar faults early.
6. Document the anomaly and maintenance actions for future reference and trend analysis.

In summary, the atmospheric pressure anomaly at AWS_DIY_UGM is a sensor fault indicated by an invalid sentinel value, not a true atmospheric event. Prompt sensor diagnostics and maintenance are essential to restore reliable data collection and ensure data integrity at the station.


The atmospheric pressure anomaly at AWS_DIY_UGM on 2024-08-15T20:10:00 shows an invalid sentinel value (-9999.0 hPa), indicating a sensor communication failure or dead pressure sensor. Due to the lack of available weather data for the requested time range around the anomaly event, a direct comparison of current weather conditions to the anomalous readings could not be performed. No additional anomalies could be confirmed from available data. The sensor reading is clearly outside the operational range, confirming a sensor fault. The primary recommendation is to perform sensor diagnostics and maintenance or replacement of the pressure sensor. Since no other anomalies were detected or data available to analyze, no correlation or common cause analysis beyond the pressure sensor failure can be established at this time.
