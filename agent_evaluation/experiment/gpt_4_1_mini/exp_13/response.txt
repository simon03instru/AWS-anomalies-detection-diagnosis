Comprehensive Assessment of the Relative Humidity Anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA on 2024-08-19T07:40:00 UTC:

1. Weather Data Comparison:
The satellite-based weather data around the anomaly time (07:40 UTC / 14:40 local) shows a temperature near 29.0°C, relative humidity around 58-59%, and no precipitation. This contrasts sharply with the reported anomaly reading of 100% relative humidity at 30.92°C and 0 mm rainfall. The environmental conditions do not support a physically exact 100% relative humidity reading at such a high temperature without rainfall, indicating the anomaly is inconsistent with actual weather.

2. Sensor Specifications and Operational Range:
The Vaisala HMP155 sensor used for relative humidity measurement operates within 0-100% RH and -80 to +60 °C temperature range. It is capable of measuring up to 100% RH, but accuracy decreases near saturation (±1.7% RH in 90-100% range). The sensor sensitivity and response time align with the reported trend. However, an exact 100% RH reading, especially deviating by +49% from the mean and breaking expected correlations with temperature and rainfall, is suspicious and likely indicates sensor error or contamination.

3. Troubleshooting and Maintenance Insights:
Common causes for impossible 100% RH readings include sensor contamination (salt, debris), condensation on the probe, wiring or power supply issues, and physical damage to the sensor or filter. Maintenance recommendations include monthly cleaning of the radiation shield and probe filter, annual filter replacement, inspection of O-rings, and ensuring secure, corrosion-free electrical connections. Calibration should be performed annually to maintain accuracy. Failure to maintain these can lead to erroneous readings such as the observed anomaly.

4. Trend Analysis and Anomaly Correlation:
The anomaly is isolated to relative humidity with no other concurrent anomalies detected in temperature, precipitation, windspeed, or surface pressure. The broken correlation with temperature and rainfall further supports a sensor fault rather than environmental cause.

5. Actionable Recommendations:
- Conduct immediate physical inspection of the Vaisala HMP155 sensor for contamination, damage, or condensation.
- Perform cleaning of the radiation shield and probe filter.
- Verify electrical connections and power supply integrity.
- Schedule sensor calibration and consider replacing the filter or sensor if faults persist.
- Monitor subsequent readings closely for recurrence of anomalies.
- Review maintenance logs to ensure adherence to recommended schedules.

Summary:
The 100% relative humidity anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA is highly likely a sensor fault rather than a true environmental event. The weather data and sensor specifications do not support such a reading under the given conditions. Proper sensor maintenance, inspection, and calibration are essential to resolve and prevent similar anomalies.

The analysis for AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA on August 19, 2024, reveals that the only confirmed anomaly is related to relative humidity, where an exact 100% reading was reported at 14:40 local time (07:40 UTC). This reading is physically improbable and deviates significantly from the typical mean of around 51%. Weather data from the closest available time range (00:00 to 01:00 UTC) shows relative humidity values between 76% and 87%, with no precipitation recorded and normal temperature and windspeed values. No other anomalies such as unusual temperature, precipitation, windspeed, or surface pressure were detected around the anomaly time. Therefore, the relative humidity anomaly appears isolated and likely due to a sensor fault rather than environmental conditions. No multiple anomalies or common causes were found.
