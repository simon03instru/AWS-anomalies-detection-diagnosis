  1. The Young 05103-L wind direction sensor has a specific operating range and sensitivity, as inferred from the context provided about R.M. Young Wind Monitors. The valid operating range for the sensor involves checking the excitation voltage and the resistance values, which should be approximately 10K ohms between the Blue and White wires, and vary between 1K to 11K depending on vane position. In the 5-degree dead band, resistance should be about 1 M ohm. Additionally, the sensor's performance can be monitored for any deviations in expected values, which may indicate a need for recalibration.

  2. The Young 05103-L wind direction sensor specifications include a valid operating range for measuring wind direction of 0 to 360 degrees with a sensitivity resolution of 0.5 degrees. The document does not specify explicit sentinel values.

  1. In the context of the AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA sensor anomalies, the presence of invalid data (such as values like -999, NaN) could be due to issues like a missing sensor rather than sensor miscalibration or other factors. Thus, the anomalies could be attributed to either data being erroneous or a sensor not being present.

  2. The question regarding sensor anomalies for the AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA on 2024-08-19T07:40:00 relates to potential errors or issues that could occur with the wind monitor (model 05103). To prevent erroneous signals or transducer damage, it is critical to ensure proper grounding of the Wind Monitor, as static electrical charge build-up can lead to inaccurate readings. Additionally, inspect for mechanical issues such as friction in the vane and propeller, ensure a stable DC excitation voltage for the potentiometer, and check for any signs of wear or malfunction in the precision conductive plastic potentiometer.



  1. The Young 05103-L wind direction sensor is likely part of the R.M. Young Wind Monitor system which measures wind speed and direction. It requires preventive maintenance, including checking the anemometer bearings and recalibrating the sensor if measurement data appears suspicious.

  2. The Young 05103-L wind direction sensor is a model designed to measure horizontal wind speed and direction. It is manufactured by R.M. Young Company, located in Traverse City, Michigan.



  1. To troubleshoot the R.M. Young 05103-L wind direction sensor communication failure indicated by the sentinel value -9999.0°, follow these steps:

1. **Check Wiring:** Ensure the sensor is wired correctly to the Excitation and Single-Ended channel as specified in the measurement instructions.
2. **Verify Excitation Voltage:** Confirm that the excitation voltage and Range code are suitable for your datalogger type.
3. **Inspect Potentiometer:** Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohmmeter to check the potentiometer. You should see:
   - About 10K ohms between the Blue and White wires.
   - Resistance between Blue/Green or White/Green should vary from 1K to 11K depending on the vane position.
   - Approximately 1 M ohm when the vane is in the 5-degree dead band.

If issues persist, consider recalibrating the sensor and ensuring that the bearings and the potentiometer are in good condition.

  2. To troubleshoot the Young 05103-L wind direction sensor communication failure resulting in a sentinel value of -9999.0°, follow these steps:

1. **Check Power Supply**: Ensure that the sensor is receiving the correct voltage and that the power supply is stable.

2. **Inspect Connections**: Verify all electrical connections and ensure that cables are secure and undamaged. 

3. **Check for obstructions**: Ensure there are no physical barriers obstructing the sensor's ability to measure wind direction.

4. **Review Sensor Settings**: Double-check the configuration settings of the wind monitor, ensuring all parameters are set correctly.

5. **Calibrate the Sensor**: If necessary, perform a recalibration of the wind sensor to ensure accurate readings.

6. **Firmware Update**: Check for any available firmware updates that might resolve communication issues.

7. **Consult the Manual**: Refer to the device manual for specific troubleshooting steps related to communication errors.

8. **Contact Support**: If the issue persists, reach out to R.M. Young Company’s technical support for further assistance.


  1. The -9999.0 reading on the Young 05103-L wind direction sensor indicates a possible fault. To troubleshoot:
1. Check the sensor wiring to ensure it is connected to the correct Excitation and Single-Ended channels.
2. Verify that the excitation voltage and Range code are compatible with the datalogger type.
3. Use an ohmmeter to check the potentiometer resistance: it should be around 10K ohms between Blue and White wires, and vary between 1K to 11K ohms between the Blue/Green or White/Green wires, depending on vane position. Resistance near 1 M ohm indicates the vane is in the dead band.
If problems persist, recalibrate the sensor and ensure the configuration parameters are correct for the datalogger.

  2. The operational range of the Young 05103-L wind direction sensor is not explicitly detailed in the provided context. However, the related Model 05103 wind monitor is used for measuring wind speed and direction, while the calibration accessory Model 18802 anemometer drive operates at 200 to 15,000 RPM for rotating an anemometer shaft. For sensitivity specifications and detailed fault analysis of the 05103-L sensor, further information or technical documentation would be required.


  1. **Troubleshooting Guides for R.M. Young 05103-L Wind Direction Sensor:**  
- **Invalid Values (-9999):**  
  1. Check wiring: Ensure the sensor is connected to the correct Excitation and Single-Ended channel.  
  2. Verify the excitation voltage and Range code for the datalogger type.  
  3. Disconnect the sensor, use an ohm meter:  
     - Resistance between Blue and White wires should be ~10K ohms.  
     - Resistance between Blue/Green or White/Green wires should vary from 1K to 11K. 
     - At dead band (5 degrees), resistance should be ~1 M ohm.  

- **Common Failure Modes:**  
  1. No change in direction = Faulty wiring or sensor issues.  
  2. Incorrect wind direction = Check excitation voltage, Range code, and sensor orientation.  

**Recommended Maintenance Actions:**  
- Inspect anemometer bearings and potentiometer every 24 months; replace if noisy or resistance thresholds exceed acceptable limits.  
- Recalibrate the sensor if measurements seem suspicious following maintenance. Only a qualified technician should perform replacements.

  2. **Troubleshooting Guides for Young 05103-L Wind Direction Sensor:**  
1. **Check for Grounding Issues:** Ensure the device is properly grounded to prevent erroneous signals or transducer damage.  
2. **Inspect Wiring and Connections:** Look for any loose or damaged connections that may affect signal transmission.  
3. **Calibration Checks:** Use a calibration device (like the Model 18112 Vane Angle Bench Stand) to confirm the accuracy of the wind direction readings.  

**Common Failure Modes:**  
1. **Potentiometer Failure:** The precision conductive plastic potentiometer may produce noisy signals or become nonlinear as it ages.  
2. **Bearing Wear:** Worn bearings can affect the performance, causing increased noise or threshold levels.
