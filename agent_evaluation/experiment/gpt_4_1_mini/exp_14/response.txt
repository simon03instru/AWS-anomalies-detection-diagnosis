Assessment Report on Wind Direction Sensor Anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA:

1. Weather Data Integration:
The weather data for Yogyakarta on August 19, 2024, around the anomaly detection time shows normal atmospheric conditions with wind directions ranging from 0° to 360°, temperatures between 22.3°C and 24.3°C, no precipitation, relative humidity from 87% to 76%, wind speeds between 3.4 and 9.5 m/s, and stable surface pressure around 997 hPa. These valid readings confirm that the anomalous wind direction value of -9999.0° is not reflective of actual weather but a sensor fault.

2. Sensor Specifications and Fault Analysis:
The Young 05103-L wind direction sensor operates within a 0° to 360° range. The reported value of -9999.0° is an invalid sentinel value indicating sensor communication failure or malfunction. This value lies far outside the operational range and is not a valid measurement.

3. Troubleshooting and Maintenance Information:
Common causes for this anomaly include wiring issues, incorrect excitation voltage, potentiometer failure, or bearing wear. Recommended troubleshooting steps are:
- Inspect and secure all wiring connections.
- Verify excitation voltage and datalogger range code compatibility.
- Measure potentiometer resistance to check for faults.
- Recalibrate the sensor and confirm datalogger settings.
Maintenance actions include replacing bearings and potentiometer every 24 months or if noisy signals are detected, ensuring proper grounding, and performing routine calibration by qualified technicians.

4. Recommendations:
- Immediate inspection and repair of the wind direction sensor wiring and electrical connections.
- Perform sensor recalibration and verify datalogger configuration.
- Schedule preventive maintenance including bearing and potentiometer replacement as per manufacturer guidelines.
- Implement routine sensor health checks to detect early signs of degradation.
- Document all maintenance and calibration activities for future reference.

5. Conclusion:
The wind direction anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA is due to sensor communication failure indicated by the sentinel value -9999.0, not actual weather conditions. Prompt maintenance and calibration are essential to restore accurate wind direction measurements and prevent recurrence. Regular preventive maintenance and monitoring will enhance sensor reliability and data quality.
