The weather data for Yogyakarta, Indonesia at latitude -7.81665 and longitude 110.29481 on August 19, 2024, around 07:40 UTC shows a temperature of approximately 28.9°C and a relative humidity of about 58-59%. There was no precipitation recorded, and windspeed was around 20.1 m/s. This contrasts sharply with the anomalous sensor reading of 0.0% relative humidity at the same time, which is physically implausible given the temperature near 29°C. The expected relative humidity based on temperature should be around 50%, consistent with the satellite-based data. The discrepancy strongly suggests a sensor malfunction or error in the Vaisala HMP155 sensor at the AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA station. The actual weather conditions indicate normal tropical humidity levels, and the 0.0% reading is an outlier and not representative of the true atmospheric state.

The Vaisala HMP155 relative humidity sensor operates within a humidity range of 0 to 100 %RH. It has a sensitivity of approximately 0.1% and an expected accuracy of ±1 %RH from 0 to 90 %RH and ±1.7 %RH from 90 to 100 %RH at temperatures between +15 to +25 °C. The response time at +20 °C in still air is 20 seconds for 63% RH and 60 seconds for 90% RH. A 0.0% humidity reading is not within normal sensor behavior and likely indicates a sensor fault or malfunction, especially given the physically impossible nature of 0% humidity under typical environmental conditions such as those reported (around 50% expected at 30.9°C). Sensor sensitivity matches expected humidity and temperature conditions, but the anomaly suggests sensor error or contamination. Regular maintenance, including filter changes and contamination checks, is recommended to ensure accuracy and proper sensor function.

Troubleshooting and Maintenance Guide for Vaisala HMP155 Sensor:

Possible Causes for 0.0% Humidity Reading:
- Faulty wiring or sensor misconfiguration.
- Contamination or blockage of the sintered Teflon filter.
- Sensor exposed to extreme temperatures outside operating range.
- Sensor malfunction or damage causing stuck readings.

Recommended Maintenance and Calibration Actions:
- Check sensor wiring and ensure correct connections and voltage (7-28 V DC).
- Clean the radiation shield and probe tip monthly to remove debris.
- Replace the probe filter annually and inspect the O-ring.
- Perform periodic sensor calibration using USB, push buttons, or MI70 indicator.
- Use appropriate radiation shields to protect the probe from harsh elements.

Checklist of Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Verify wiring and power supply to the sensor.
2. Inspect sensor connections and ensure secure fit.
3. Check for contamination or blockage on the sensor filter and clean if necessary.
4. Confirm sensor installation and orientation are correct.
5. Evaluate environmental conditions to rule out condensation, fog, or extreme temperatures.
6. Calibrate the sensor and verify calibration parameters (multiplier and offset).
7. Confirm sensor response times meet specifications.
8. Maintain a power-up delay of at least 1.8 seconds to avoid initial inaccuracies.

This guidance addresses common failure modes and maintenance procedures to resolve anomalous 0.0% humidity readings and ensure reliable Vaisala HMP155 sensor operation.

Assessment Report on Relative Humidity Anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA on 2024-08-19T07:40:00 UTC:

1. Anomaly Summary:
- The Vaisala HMP155 sensor reported a physically impossible 0.0% relative humidity reading at 07:40 UTC.
- Actual weather data from satellite-based sources and nearby time points show relative humidity around 58-59% with temperature near 29°C, consistent with tropical conditions.
- No other weather parameters (temperature, precipitation, windspeed, surface pressure) showed anomalies, confirming the anomaly is isolated to the humidity sensor.

2. Sensor Operational Context:
- Vaisala HMP155 operates from 0 to 100% RH with high sensitivity and accuracy.
- A 0.0% reading under these environmental conditions is outside normal sensor behavior and indicates malfunction.

3. Possible Causes:
- Sensor contamination or blockage of the sintered Teflon filter.
- Faulty wiring or sensor misconfiguration.
- Sensor damage or internal malfunction.
- Environmental factors such as extreme temperature exposure or improper installation.

4. Recommended Actions:
- Immediate physical inspection of the sensor and wiring for damage or loose connections.
- Clean or replace the sensor filter and inspect the radiation shield.
- Perform sensor recalibration using manufacturer-recommended procedures.
- Verify sensor installation and orientation.
- Monitor sensor readings closely after maintenance to confirm resolution.
- If anomaly persists, consider sensor replacement to ensure data reliability.

5. Next Steps for Investigation:
- Review recent maintenance logs and sensor calibration history.
- Cross-check with nearby stations or sensors for corroborative data.
- Implement a temporary data quality flagging for the humidity sensor until issue is resolved.

Conclusion:
The 0% relative humidity reading is a sensor anomaly likely caused by malfunction or contamination. Prompt maintenance and recalibration are essential to restore accurate humidity measurements. Replacement should be considered if issues persist after troubleshooting. No broader weather event explains this anomaly, so focus should be on sensor health and data integrity.

The analysis around the anomaly detection time at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA (2024-08-19T07:40:00 UTC) shows that the reported anomaly of 0% relative humidity is indeed an outlier and physically impossible. Weather data from 07:30 to 07:45 UTC indicates relative humidity values around 58-59%, temperature near 29°C, no precipitation, moderate windspeed around 20.1 m/s, and stable surface pressure around 993.6-993.7 hPa. These normal humidity values strongly contrast with the anomalous 0% reading, confirming a sensor malfunction rather than an actual weather event.

No other anomalies in temperature, precipitation, windspeed, wind direction, or surface pressure were detected around the anomaly time. The weather conditions appear typical for the location and time, with no signs of abrupt changes or extreme events that could explain the humidity anomaly.

In summary, the only anomaly is the relative humidity sensor reading of 0%, which is likely due to sensor malfunction or calibration error. There are no multiple anomalies or correlated weather parameter anomalies at this time. Recommended actions include sensor maintenance, recalibration, or replacement to ensure accurate humidity measurements.
