The weather data for UGM Yogyakarta, Indonesia on August 15, 2024, around 20:00 UTC shows no precipitation recorded in the hour surrounding the event time, with precipitation values consistently at 0.0 mm. Surface pressure remained stable around 994.9 to 995.0 hPa, and temperature was steady around 20.5°C. These conditions strongly contrast with the reported rainfall anomaly of 100 mm in 10 minutes, which is not supported by the satellite-based weather data. The lack of any pressure drop or temperature change further supports the assessment that the rainfall sensor reading was a spurious spike likely due to sensor malfunction. Therefore, the anomaly is not corroborated by actual weather conditions, indicating a sensor fault rather than a real weather event.

The HYQUEST TB4 rainfall sensor has an operational range up to 700 mm per hour. Its accuracy varies with rainfall intensity: for 0-100 mm per hour, accuracy is better than +/-2%, and for higher intensities up to 300 mm per hour, accuracy decreases but remains within +/-10%. Given this, a reported rainfall of 100 mm in 10 minutes corresponds to 600 mm per hour, which is within the sensor's maximum measurable range but at the high end of its range where accuracy is lower. Therefore, while the sensor can technically measure such a high rainfall rate, the reported value of 100 mm in 10 minutes is extreme and unusual, suggesting the possibility of sensor malfunction or anomaly, especially considering no concurrent environmental changes were observed.

Troubleshooting guides for the HYQUEST TB4 rainfall sensor include checking wiring to the pulse/control terminal, verifying configuration parameters, and testing switch continuity. Common failure modes involve tipping mechanism blockage or dirt and electrical connection failures. Maintenance procedures recommend regular cleaning of the catch filter, siphon, bucket interior, screws, and insect screens, as well as checking the tipping assembly movement and data logger tip recording. Causes for spurious rainfall spikes include debris obstruction (e.g., leaves, bird droppings), electrical interference, and mechanical failures within the tipping bucket mechanism. Recommended maintenance actions are to regularly clean the finger filter and collector area, inspect electrical connections and cables for damage or wear, and perform periodic functional tests and calibrations using a Portable Field Calibration Device (FCD) to ensure accurate measurements and minimize downtime.

The rainfall anomaly reported at AWS_DIY_UGM station on 2024-08-15T20:00:00, showing 100 mm in 10 minutes, is highly likely a sensor malfunction. Satellite-based weather data for the location and time show no precipitation, with values consistently at 0.0 mm in the hour surrounding the event. Surface pressure remained stable around 995 hPa, and temperature was steady around 20.5°C, with no environmental changes supporting heavy rainfall. The HYQUEST TB4 sensor used has an operational range up to 700 mm per hour and can technically measure such high rainfall, but the reported value is extreme and unusual, especially without corroborating weather conditions.

Common causes for such spurious rainfall spikes include debris obstruction, electrical interference, and mechanical failures in the tipping bucket mechanism. Recommended maintenance actions include:
1. Verify and clean the sensor's catch filter, siphon, bucket interior, screws, and insect screens to remove any debris.
2. Inspect wiring and electrical connections for damage or wear and ensure proper configuration.
3. Test the tipping mechanism for smooth operation and check data logger tip recording.
4. Perform functional tests and calibrations using a Portable Field Calibration Device (FCD) to ensure accuracy.

Data validation should include cross-checking sensor data with nearby stations or satellite data to identify anomalies early. Regular maintenance and calibration schedules should be established to minimize sensor faults and ensure reliable rainfall measurements.

After reviewing the available data and the initial anomaly report for the AWS_DIY_UGM station, there is only one confirmed anomaly detected, which is the rainfall sensor reporting 100 mm in a 10-minute interval. This anomaly is highly likely due to a sensor malfunction, as the satellite-based weather data for the same period shows no precipitation, stable surface pressure around 995 hPa, and steady temperature around 20.5°C. There are no other anomalies detected in parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, or pressure. Therefore, no multiple anomalies exist to analyze for correlations or common causes. The single anomaly is best explained as a spurious sensor fault, and maintenance or sensor troubleshooting is recommended to address this issue.
