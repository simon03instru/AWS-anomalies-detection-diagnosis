Assessment Report on Wind Direction Anomaly at AWS_DIY_UGM Station

1. Summary of Findings:
- The wind direction sensor at AWS_DIY_UGM reported an invalid sentinel value of -9999.0°, which is far outside the valid range of 0-360°.
- Historical weather data around the anomaly time (2024-08-15T20:00 UTC) showed stable wind direction values between 317° and 328°, indicating normal atmospheric conditions.
- The Young 05103-L wind direction sensor, used at this station, operates within 0-360° with 0.5° resolution. The reported -9999.0 value is a known indicator of sensor communication failure or hardware fault.

2. Possible Causes:
- Sensor communication failure due to wiring issues or loose connections.
- Incorrect excitation voltage or range code settings in the datalogger.
- Potentiometer malfunction or wear, causing invalid readings.
- Sensor hardware damage or failure, possibly from environmental exposure or mechanical wear.

3. Recommended Actions:
- Immediately inspect and verify sensor wiring connections to the Excitation and Single-Ended channels.
- Confirm that excitation voltage and range code settings in the datalogger match the sensor specifications.
- Measure potentiometer resistance with an ohmmeter; expected values are ~10K ohms between Blue and White wires and 1K-11K ohms between other pairs depending on vane position.
- If wiring and settings are correct but issue persists, recalibrate the sensor using a vane angle bench stand ensuring alignment within 5° accuracy.
- Inspect and maintain or replace sensor bearings and potentiometer if worn or noisy, especially if the sensor has been in use for a long period.
- Ensure proper grounding to prevent static discharge damage.
- Schedule sensor replacement if hardware faults cannot be resolved through maintenance.

4. Next Steps:
- Conduct immediate on-site inspection and troubleshooting following the above maintenance guide.
- Document findings and repair actions taken.
- Monitor sensor output closely after maintenance to confirm restoration of valid wind direction data.
- Consider implementing remote diagnostics or alerts for early detection of similar sensor failures in the future.

This comprehensive assessment confirms the anomaly is due to sensor failure rather than environmental conditions. Prompt maintenance and possible replacement are necessary to restore reliable wind direction measurements at AWS_DIY_UGM.


There is only one confirmed anomaly reported for the AWS_DIY_UGM station, which is related to the wind direction sensor showing an invalid sentinel value (-9999.0°), indicating a sensor communication failure. Since only this single anomaly is present, no further correlation analysis is needed. The anomaly is confidently attributed to a faulty wind direction sensor.
