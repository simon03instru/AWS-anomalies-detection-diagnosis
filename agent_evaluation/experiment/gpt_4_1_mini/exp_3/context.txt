3. **Inspect Filter**: Clean or replace the probe filter if it is contaminated. Remove the filter and check the O-ring.
4. **Sensor Element Check**: Verify the sensor element is correctly plugged in and is free of moisture or corrosion.
5. **Calibration**: If the problem persists, consider recalibrating the HMP155 annually or replacing the sensor element to ensure accuracy.
6. **Maintenance**: Regularly clean the probe, inspect the radiation shield for debris, and ensure that the installation environment does not interfere with readings.

  2. For troubleshooting and calibration of the Vaisala HMP155 humidity probe, check the following:
1. **Calibration**: The probe can be calibrated using a computer via USB, using the push buttons, or with the MI70 indicator. 
2. **Zero Percent Humidity Measurement**: Ensure the probe is not exposed to moisture or condensation, as this can affect readings. 
3. **Cleaning**: Use a sintered Teflon filter for protection. For cleaning, ensure the probe is powered off and dried out to avoid damage. 
4. **Replacement**: If the sensor shows constant erroneous readings after calibration, consider replacing the probe or its key components.
5. **Environmental Consideration**: Ensure the unit is used within specified ranges (0-100% RH, -80 to +60 °C) for optimal performance. 
For detailed guidance, refer to the manufacturer's manual.



  1. The operational range sensitivity of the Vaisala HMP155 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context.

Its accuracy is ±1 %RH (0 to 90 %RH) and ±1.7 %RH (90 to 100 %RH) at +15 to +25 °C. Operating humidity is between 0 and 100 %RH, with a storage temperature ranging from -80 to +60 °C.



  1. To troubleshoot a Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor reading 0%, check the following:
1. Ensure the sensor is wired correctly to the designated analog input channels.
2. Verify the range code for your measurement setup corresponds correctly to your data logger.
3. Check that the red power wire is connected to the 12V or SW12V channel.
4. Temporarily connect the red wire to a 12V terminal and use a voltmeter to measure output voltage.
5. If issues persist, inspect the probe's filter for contamination, clean it if necessary, and ensure the sensor element is functioning.

  2. If the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor is showing a 0% reading, it could indicate a few potential issues:

1. **Wet Probe Condition**: In high humidity environments, condensation may form on the probe, leading to inaccurate readings. Ensure the probe is properly warmed to avoid this.

2. **Sensor Calibration**: The sensor may need recalibration, especially if it hasn't been calibrated recently or is showing erratic readings.

3. **Obstruction**: Check if any obstructions, such as dirt or water in the sintered Teflon filter, are preventing accurate measurements.

4. **Electrical Issues**: Ensure proper power supply and that the connections (USB, RS-485, etc.) are secure.

5. **Sensor Damage**: Inspect the probe and housing for possible physical damage that could affect performance or accuracy.

For troubleshooting, consider recalibrating the device or inspecting it for moisture or blockage. If problems persist, consult Vaisala's support or technical documentation.
