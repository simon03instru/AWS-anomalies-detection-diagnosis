Assessment of Temperature Anomaly at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit on August 16, 2024:

1. Summary of Anomaly:
- A sudden temperature drop to 2.96°C was recorded at 22:30 local time (UTC+7), representing a ~25°C decrease from the 20-interval mean of 28.1°C.
- This reading is a >3σ outlier and shows a broken correlation with relative humidity, which remained stable at 88%.

2. Weather Data Comparison:
- Actual weather data around the anomaly time shows temperature consistently around 12.1°C with relative humidity steady at 88%.
- The anomalous temperature reading of 2.96°C is significantly lower than the observed ambient temperature, indicating inconsistency with environmental conditions.

3. Sensor Operational Range and Sensitivity:
- The Vaisala HMP155 sensor operates reliably between -80°C and +60°C.
- The anomalous reading is within the sensor's operational range but the magnitude of the sudden drop exceeds typical sensor accuracy and sensitivity limits.

4. Likely Cause of Anomaly:
- Given the broken correlation with humidity and the discrepancy with actual weather data, the anomaly is most likely due to sensor malfunction rather than environmental factors.
- Possible causes include sensor wiring issues, contamination of the probe or filter, or calibration drift.

5. Recommended Actions:
- Perform immediate inspection of sensor wiring and connections.
- Clean or replace the sensor's probe filter and radiation shield to prevent condensation or debris interference.
- Conduct sensor calibration using recommended procedures and tools (e.g., MI70 indicator or USB connection).
- Monitor sensor readings closely for recurrence of anomalies.
- Consider scheduling annual recalibration and maintenance to ensure long-term sensor accuracy.

6. Monitoring and Follow-up:
- Implement automated alerts for sudden temperature deviations and broken humidity correlations.
- Cross-check sensor data with nearby stations or alternative sensors to validate readings.

Conclusion:
The temperature anomaly detected at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit on August 16, 2024, is most plausibly caused by sensor malfunction rather than actual environmental changes. Prompt maintenance and calibration are advised to restore reliable sensor performance and prevent future data quality issues.
