  1. The operational temperature range sensitivity of the Vaisala HMP155 is primarily affected by the functioning of the Pt100 temperature sensor, which is soldered to the probe. Regular maintenance, including checking the probe filter and ensuring that the sensor is clean, is essential to maintain measurement accuracy and response time.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 has an operational temperature range of -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F). It features a fast response time for temperature measurements, specifically less than 20 seconds for a 63% response and less than 35 seconds for a 90% response in air flow.



  1. To troubleshoot a sudden temperature drop in the Vaisala HMP155, follow these steps:  
1. **Check Wiring**: Ensure the sensor is wired correctly to the analog input channels.  
2. **Power Supply**: Verify that the red power wire is connected to the correct 12V terminal.  
3. **Voltage Check**: Use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for temperature and humidity on the respective wires.  
4. **Recalibrate**: Recalibrate the HMP155A annually.  
5. **Clean the Probe**: Use a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent to clean the probe; also check the white screen for contaminants.  
6. **Change Filter**: If the probe filter is contaminated, change it and ensure the O-ring is checked and replaced if necessary.  
7. **Annual Replacement**: Consider replacing the sensor element annually to maintain calibration accuracy.  

Refer to the detailed maintenance and troubleshooting sections in the provided context for more comprehensive guidance.

  2. To troubleshoot sudden temperature drops in the Vaisala HMP155, you may consider the following steps:

1. **Calibration**: Ensure that the probe is properly calibrated. You can calibrate the probe using a computer with a USB cable, push buttons, or an MI70 indicator.

2. **Cleaning**: Check if the sintered teflon filter or membrane is clean. If it's contaminated, clean or replace it to ensure accurate measurements, especially in humid conditions.

3. **Replacement of Faulty Parts**: If issues persist, consider replacing the additional temperature probe or other components that may be contributing to the problem.

4. **Check Installation**: Ensure that the probe is correctly installed in a suitable radiation shield (like DTR503, DTR13, or a Stevenson screen) to protect against environmental conditions.

5. **Monitor Environmental Conditions**: Sudden drops in temperature readings may also occur due to rapid environmental changes. Verify if the calibration is within the specified accuracy limits in the current temperature range.


  1. The operational temperature range sensitivity of the Vaisala HMP155 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context. However, it is indicated that the Pt100 temperature sensor, which is soldered to the HMP155 probe, does not require maintenance and is integral to the temperature measurement.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 has an operational temperature range of -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F). It provides accurate temperature measurements within this range, with varying accuracy levels depending on the specific temperature intervals.



  1. A sudden temperature drop affecting the Vaisala HMP155 sensor could necessitate maintenance actions such as checking and possibly recalibrating the sensor to ensure accurate temperature and humidity readings. This includes inspecting the probe, changing the filter if contaminated, and ensuring proper wiring and power supply.

  2. A sudden temperature drop experienced by the Vaisala HMP155 probe can necessitate maintenance actions, specifically calibration, to ensure accurate temperature measurements. The probe includes features for calibration using a computer, push buttons, or the MI70 indicator to adjust for any inaccuracies caused by such temperature fluctuations.



  1. The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor has the Pt100 sensor soldered to the probe. The specific operational temperature range and sensitivity specifications are not detailed in the provided context. However, typical Pt100 temperature sensors operate within a range of -200 to +850 °C with a sensitivity of 0.1 °C.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor has an operational temperature range of −80 to +60 °C (−112 to +140 °F). Its sensitivity specifications include an accuracy of ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × temperature) °C at −80 to +20 °C and ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × temperature) °C at +20 to +60 °C.



  1. To troubleshoot sudden temperature drops and broken correlation with humidity in the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor, follow these recommended maintenance actions:

1. **Check Sensor Wiring:** Ensure the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels and that the red power wire is correctly connected to the 12V or SW12V channel.

2. **Verify Calibration Settings:** Check the multiplier and offset parameters for the data logger to ensure they are set correctly for the desired units.

3. **Inspect Probe and Shield:** Monthly maintenance should include checking that the radiation shield is free from debris and contaminants on the sensor tip. The probe filter may need to be replaced if contaminated.

4. **Clean and Replace Filters:** If the response time is delayed or accuracy decreases, inspect the probe filter and replace it if necessary. Rinse filters gently in distilled water if required.

5. **Annual Recalibration:** It is recommended to recalibrate the HMP155 annually to maintain measurement accuracy. If sensor performance is suspect, replace the sensor element for optimal calibration state.

By following these steps, you can address issues with sudden temperature drops and correlation with humidity.

  2. ### Troubleshooting and Maintenance for Vaisala HMP155 Temperature Sensor

**Sudden Temperature Drops & Broken Correlation with Humidity:**  
- Sudden drops in temperature readings may occur due to environmental factors such as extreme humidity levels, fog, or condensation on the probe. Ensure the probe is properly shielded from direct precipitation and radiation.
- Verify the functionality of the warmed probe feature, as it helps prevent condensation and improves measurement accuracy in high humidity environments.

**Recommended Maintenance Actions:**  
- Regularly check and clean the sintered Teflon filter to ensure unobstructed airflow and accurate humidity measurements.
- Ensure the sensor is installed in appropriate radiation shields (e.g., DTR503, DTR13, or Stevenson screen) to protect from environmental elements.
- Use the MI70 indicator or USB connection for routine checks and troubleshooting.

**Calibration Procedures:**  
- The HMP155 can be calibrated using a computer with a USB cable, via push buttons, or using the MI70 indicator. Calibration should be done regularly to maintain accuracy, especially after prolonged exposure to adverse conditions.
