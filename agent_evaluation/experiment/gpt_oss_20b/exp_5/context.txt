  1. The operational temperature range sensitivity of the Vaisala HMP155 is primarily affected by the functioning of the Pt100 temperature sensor, which is soldered to the probe. Regular maintenance, including checking the probe filter and ensuring that the sensor is clean, is essential to maintain measurement accuracy and response time.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 has an operational temperature range of -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F). It features a fast response time for temperature measurements, specifically less than 20 seconds for a 63% response and less than 35 seconds for a 90% response in air flow.



  1. To troubleshoot a sudden temperature drop in the Vaisala HMP155, follow these steps:  
1. **Check Wiring**: Ensure the sensor is wired correctly to the analog input channels.  
2. **Power Supply**: Verify that the red power wire is connected to the correct 12V terminal.  
3. **Voltage Check**: Use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for temperature and humidity on the respective wires.  
4. **Recalibrate**: Recalibrate the HMP155A annually.  
5. **Clean the Probe**: Use a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent to clean the probe; also check the white screen for contaminants.  
6. **Change Filter**: If the probe filter is contaminated, change it and ensure the O-ring is checked and replaced if necessary.  
7. **Annual Replacement**: Consider replacing the sensor element annually to maintain calibration accuracy.  

Refer to the detailed maintenance and troubleshooting sections in the provided context for more comprehensive guidance.

  2. To troubleshoot sudden temperature drops in the Vaisala HMP155, you may consider the following steps:

1. **Calibration**: Ensure that the probe is properly calibrated. You can calibrate the probe using a computer with a USB cable, push buttons, or an MI70 indicator.

2. **Cleaning**: Check if the sintered teflon filter or membrane is clean. If it's contaminated, clean or replace it to ensure accurate measurements, especially in humid conditions.

3. **Replacement of Faulty Parts**: If issues persist, consider replacing the additional temperature probe or other components that may be contributing to the problem.

4. **Check Installation**: Ensure that the probe is correctly installed in a suitable radiation shield (like DTR503, DTR13, or a Stevenson screen) to protect against environmental conditions.

5. **Monitor Environmental Conditions**: Sudden drops in temperature readings may also occur due to rapid environmental changes. Verify if the calibration is within the specified accuracy limits in the current temperature range.



  1. The operational temperature range sensitivity of the Vaisala HMP155 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context. However, it is indicated that the Pt100 temperature sensor, which is soldered to the HMP155 probe, does not require maintenance and is integral to the temperature measurement.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 has an operational temperature range of -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F). It provides accurate temperature measurements within this range, with varying accuracy levels depending on the specific temperature intervals.


  1. A sudden temperature drop affecting the Vaisala HMP155 sensor could necessitate maintenance actions such as checking and possibly recalibrating the sensor to ensure accurate temperature and humidity readings. This includes inspecting the probe, changing the filter if contaminated, and ensuring proper wiring and power supply.

  2. A sudden temperature drop experienced by the Vaisala HMP155 probe can necessitate maintenance actions, specifically calibration, to ensure accurate temperature measurements. The probe includes features for calibration using a computer, push buttons, or the MI70 indicator to adjust for any inaccuracies caused by such temperature fluctuations.
