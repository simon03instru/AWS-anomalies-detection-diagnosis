  1. The Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor has an operational humidity range from 0% to 100% relative humidity. The accuracy is typically within ±2% of the measurement range, and the sensitivity is generally about 0.1% relative humidity.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor has an operational humidity range of 0 to 100 %RH. Its accuracy includes: ±1 %RH (0 … 90 %RH) and ±1.7 %RH (90 … 100 %RH) at temperatures between +15 to +25 °C. Sensitivity is detailed as part of its calibration: ±(1.0 + 0.008 × reading) %RH for temperatures between −20 to +40 °C, and ±(1.2 + 0.012 × reading) %RH for other specified ranges.

  1. To troubleshoot implausible humidity readings (e.g., -9999, NAN, 0%) in the Vaisala HMP155, follow these steps:

1. **Check Wiring**: Ensure that the sensor is connected to the correct analog input channels.
2. **Verify Measurements**: Confirm that the range code matches the data logger type and that the red power wire is connected to a 12V source.
3. **Check Output Voltage**: Use a voltmeter to check the output voltages for temperature and relative humidity.

If readings are still incorrect:
- Inspect for contaminants on the sensor and probe filter, and clean or replace them as necessary.
- Ensure the sensor has been properly calibrated, and recalibrate annually.
- Verify sensor communications if readings remain unstable. Clean debris from the radiation shield and ensure that it is functioning properly.

  2. To troubleshoot zero humidity and implausible humidity readings with the Vaisala HMP155, consider the following steps:

1. **Cleaning**: Ensure that the sintered Teflon filter is clean and free from dirt and moisture, as a clogged filter can affect readings.

2. **Calibration**: Verify the calibration of the HMP155 using a USB connection or the MI70 indicator. Factory calibration uncertainty is ±0.6 %RH (0 ... 40 %RH) and ±1.0 %RH (40 ... 95 %RH).

3. **Check the Environment**: Ensure that the probe is not exposed to conditions that could saturate the humidity measurement, such as fog or heavy dew, since the warmed probe mitigates these issues.

4. **Inspect the Probe**: If the probe has been in use for an extended period, check for signs of wear or damage. It may need replacement if it does not provide accurate readings.

5. **Connections**: Ensure all connections are secure and that the operating voltage is within the correct range (7 ... 28 V DC).

If problems persist after these checks, consider contacting Vaisala support for further assistance.


  1. The operational humidity range sensitivity for the Vaisala HMP155 sensor is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it emphasizes the importance of maintenance, such as changing the probe filter regularly, to maintain measurement accuracy, as probe filter contamination can impact response time and accuracy.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 humidity measurement operates in the range of 0 to 100 %RH. Its accuracy varies with different humidity levels and temperatures, with a factory calibration uncertainty of ±0.6 %RH (0 … 40 %RH) and ±1.0 %RH (40 … 95 %RH). The response times for relative humidity measurements are 20 seconds for 63% and 60 seconds for 90%, at +20 °C.


  1. To troubleshoot a zero humidity reading on the Vaisala HMP155:
1. Check that the sensor is correctly wired to the specified analog input channels.
2. Verify that the range code for the measurement instructions is correct for your data logger.
3. Ensure the red power wire is properly connected to the 12V channel and use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for temperature and relative humidity.
4. If symptoms like –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0% are reported, ensure the probe filter is clean and replace it if contaminated. Clean the sensor tip if needed and check for any contamination or corrosion in the sensor connection.

  2. To troubleshoot zero humidity readings on the Vaisala HMP155, consider the following steps: 
1. **Check the Environment**: Ensure the probe is not in a highly humid environment (e.g., fog, mist, rain) which can affect readings.  
2. **Inspect the Probe**: Verify that the sintered Teflon filter is clean and intact, as contamination can lead to inaccurate readings. 
3. **Warmed Probe Feature**: Make sure the warmed probe feature is functioning, as it helps keep the humidity level inside the sensor below ambient levels, reducing the risk of condensation. 
4. **Calibration**: Calibrate the probe using a computer with a USB cable or through the MI70 indicator to ensure accuracy. 
5. **Connections**: Check that all electrical connections are secure and that the device is powered correctly (7-28 V DC output). 
6. **Installation**: Ensure the probe is properly installed in a suitable radiation shield to protect it from environmental factors.
7. **Consult Datasheet**: Refer to the HMP155 datasheet for additional technical specifications or operational guidelines.



  1. A sensor model refers to the configuration and characteristics of a sensor used for data collection. In the context provided, issues with data validity, such as sentinel values, may indicate problems related to sensor adjustments, data gathering, or potential absence of the sensor.

  2. The sensor model is the HMP155, which is a humidity and temperature probe suitable for meteorological applications. It requires the MI70 indicator and a USB connection cable for calibration.



  1. A sensor model is related to the validity of data collected by a sensor. When data is invalid or contains sentinel values (e.g., -999, NaN), the issue may not be with the calibration or adjustment of the sensor, but rather with problems like missing sensors, power issues, cabling, or data logger programming. Adjusting a sensor may also be necessary to ensure accurate measurements.

  2. The sensor model is the "Vaisala Barocap Sensor," which is a silicon capacitive absolute pressure sensor developed by Vaisala for barometric pressure applications.
