  1. The operational pressure range of the Vaisala PTB110 atmospheric pressure sensor is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is important to note that the PTB110 does not require regular maintenance and has no replaceable parts, which suggests it is designed for durable use. Its sensitivity is not detailed either, but if malfunctioning, it should be replaced. The mention of ‘-9999.0 hPa’ likely indicates a placeholder for pressure readings outside of the operational limits.

  2. The specification for the Vaisala PTB110 atmospheric pressure sensor is not directly provided in the context. However, it mentions the PTB210, which is a reliable outdoor barometer for harsh conditions and includes different pressure ranges and operational humidity conditions. The sensitivity for the PTB110 is noted as -9999.0 hPa, but specific operational pressure ranges are not available in the provided information.



  1. The communication failure of the Vaisala PTB110 pressure sensor showing -9999.0 hPa could indicate invalid data. This might stem from various issues, but it is notably not caused by a missing sensor or require sensor adjustment. To troubleshoot, check the sensor's connections, and verify that it is correctly configured and operational.

  2. To troubleshoot the Vaisala PTB110 pressure sensor communication failure indicated by -9999.0 hPa, first ensure that the sensor is operating within the correct humidity conditions and pressure range specified for the device. Check the connections and power supply to the sensor, as well as any potential environmental factors affecting its operation.


  1. The operating range of the Vaisala PTB110 pressure sensor is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Additional specifications may be needed to determine the exact pressure operating range.

  2. The operating pressure range for the Vaisala PTB110 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but it is related to the pressure range of the PTB210 model.



  1. The -9999.0 hPa reading from the Vaisala PTB110 sensor indicates invalid data, which is not caused by a missing sensor or sensor adjustment issues. Troubleshooting steps may include checking the sensor calibration, ensuring proper connections, and verifying the environmental conditions affecting the sensor.

  2. The Vaisala PTB110 sensor displaying -9999.0 hPa could indicate a malfunction or an error in measurement, potentially related to its operating humidity conditions. Ensure the sensor is functioning within the specified operating humidity range and check for any condensation which could affect performance. Additionally, verify the pressure range settings and compatibility with the PTB210 model specifications.


  1. The operating pressure range of the Vaisala PTB110 pressure sensor is not specified in the provided context.

  2. The operating pressure range for the Vaisala PTB110 pressure sensor is not explicitly provided in the context. However, it does reference the PTB210 model, which has a pressure range. Further details on the specific pressure range for PTB110 would need to be sourced from product specifications or datasheets.



  1. The provided context does not specify the operating pressure range of the Vaisala PTB110 pressure sensor.

  2. The operating pressure range for the Vaisala PTB110 pressure sensor is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is indicated that there are different pressure ranges available for the PTB210 model, which might suggest a similar range exists for the PTB110.



  1. The operating pressure range of the Vaisala PTB110 pressure sensor is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

  2. The context does not specify the exact operating pressure range for the Vaisala PTB110 pressure sensor. However, it mentions the Vaisala PTB210, which is described as having different pressure ranges available.



  1. The operating pressure range for the Vaisala PTB110 is not specified in the provided context.

  2. The operating pressure range for the Vaisala PTB110 is not explicitly stated in the provided context, as it refers to the PTB210. However, it mentions that the PTB210 has different pressure ranges available.
