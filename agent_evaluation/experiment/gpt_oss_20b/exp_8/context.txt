  1. The operational temperature range specifications for the Vaisala HMP155 are not explicitly detailed in the provided context. However, it is noted that the HMP155 uses a Pt100 temperature sensor, which typically operates within a range of similar industrial devices, often between -50 °C to +100 °C. The response characteristics can decline if maintenance protocols are not followed, particularly if the sensor element is contaminated, affecting measurement accuracy.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 has an operational temperature range of -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F), making it suitable for various environmental conditions. Its response characteristics for temperature measurement include a response time of <20 seconds for 63% and <35 seconds for 90% precision in 3 m/s (7 mph) airflow.

  1. To troubleshoot sudden low temperature readings in the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, first ensure the sensor is correctly wired to the appropriate analog input channels and that the power is correctly supplied to the sensor. Check for any signs of damage or contamination on the sensor element and probe filter. If the readings are still incorrect, verify the calibration settings and replace the probe filter and O-ring if needed, as a contaminated filter can affect measurement accuracy. Recalibrate the sensor annually to maintain accuracy.

  2. To troubleshoot sudden low temperature readings from the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, consider the following steps:
1. **Check Calibration:** Ensure the sensor is calibrated properly. It can be calibrated using a computer with a USB cable, push buttons, or with the MI70 indicator.
2. **Inspect for Faults:** Look for any visible damage to the sensor or its connections, especially if there has been exposure to harsh environmental conditions.
3. **Confirm Installation:** Ensure the probe is installed correctly and is in a suitable environment. The HMP155 is designed for outdoor applications but should be protected from direct solar radiation and precipitation.
4. **Examine Warmed Probe Functionality:** If the humidity is near saturation, the optional warmed probe may not be functioning correctly, affecting temperature readings.
5. **Check Power Supply:** Verify that the power supply to the sensor is within required levels (7 to 28 V DC) and that there are no issues with the wiring.
6. **Consider Replacement:** If troubleshooting does not resolve the issue, consider replacing the sensor or the probe, especially if it is out of warranty.


  1. The operational temperature range sensitivity of the Vaisala HMP155 is not explicitly stated in the provided information. However, it is indicated that the HMP155 utilizes a Pt100 temperature sensor soldered to the probe, which typically operates with a high degree of accuracy within specified temperature ranges, usually between -40 °C to +60 °C for similar sensors.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 has an operational temperature range of -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F). It provides fast measurements with response times of <20 seconds for 63% and <35 seconds for 90% in air flow of 3 m/s (7 mph). The accuracy for the temperature measurement varies with the temperature range used.



  1. To troubleshoot sudden drops in temperature readings from the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, consider the following steps:

1. **Check Wiring**: Ensure the sensor is wired correctly to the appropriate analog input channels. Verify the power connections and that the red power wire is connected to the proper 12V channel.

2. **Verify Measurement Instructions**: Ensure that the range code and measurement instructions align with the data logger type.

3. **Test Output Voltage**: With the sensor powered, use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for temperature. The reading can be calculated using the formula: temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0.

4. **Clean and Change Filters**: Inspect and clean the radiation shield and probe tip for debris. Change the probe filter if it shows signs of contamination or is clogged.

5. **Check for Salt Buildup**: In coastal environments, clean the sensor components if there's a build-up of salt, as it can affect humidity readings.

6. **Recalibrate Annually**: Schedule annual recalibration of the HMP155A to ensure accuracy.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, consider checking for faults within the sensor element itself or consult the manufacturer for further support.

  2. To troubleshoot sudden drop faults in the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor, consider the following maintenance tips:
1. **Check for Water Intrusion**: Ensure that the sensor is protected from precipitation, and verify that any sintered Teflon filter is intact to prevent water damage.
2. **Inspect Installation**: Make sure the sensor is properly installed in an appropriate radiation shield (DTR503, DTR13, or Stevenson screen) to protect against extreme environmental conditions.
3. **Examine Calibration**: Periodically calibrate the sensor using a computer or the MI70 indicator to maintain accuracy.
4. **Verify Power Supply**: Ensure the operating voltage is consistent (7-28 V DC) and check for power supply issues.
5. **Environmental Conditions**: Assess the surrounding conditions, as high humidity, fog, or mist can affect measurement accuracy. The warmed probe option can minimize these effects.

Regular maintenance and checks can help prevent these sudden drops in sensor readings.
