  1. The operational range sensitivity specifications for the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer involve checking the data returned from the sensor, as it shows the first indication of a fault. The recommended recalibration period is every two years due to potential drift with time and exposure to radiation. Specific troubleshooting steps include verifying wiring and impedance, checking voltage output, and ensuring the right calibration factor is entered into the data logger.

  2. The Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer's operational range sensitivity specifications are not explicitly detailed in the provided context. However, it is noted that the CMP6 (which is an improved model) has a sensitivity of 5 to 20 µV/W/m² and an expected output range of 0 to 1500 W/m². The CMP6 is also classified under ISO 9060:2018 as Spectrally Flat Class B, ensuring high-quality measurements of solar irradiance.


  1. Common causes for zero radiation output in the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer include:

1. **Wiring Issues**: Check that the sensor is wired to the correct terminal specified by the measurement instruction.
2. **Calibration Factor**: Ensure that the correct calibration factor is entered into the data logger program.
3. **Impedance Check**: Measure the impedance across the sensor wires; it should be around 100 ohms plus cable resistance. Low resistance may indicate a short circuit or water ingress.
4. **Voltage Output**: Disconnect the sensor cable and check for a voltage output. It should be approximately 2.5 mV when positioned below a 60 W incandescent light bulb. No voltage suggests a sensor problem.
5. **Environmental Factors**: Dew, frost, or ice on the outer dome can affect readings. Also, check for electromagnetic radiation interference affecting the signal.

  2. Common causes of zero radiation output in Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometers may include:
1. Calibration Issues: The sensor may not be properly calibrated, leading to incorrect readings.
2. Component Failure: Internal components like the thermopile sensor may have failed.
3. Environmental Obstructions: Physical blockage or dirt on the sensor might prevent accurate readings.
4. Power Supply Problems: If the instrument requires power (specific models) and it is not supplied correctly, it may result in zero readings.
5. Temperature Effects: Operating outside the specified temperature range could affect the instrument's performance.

Diagnostic repair steps:
- Check for dirt or obstructions on the sensor.
- Verify calibration and perform recalibration if necessary.
- Inspect the internal components for damage or faults.
- Ensure that the power supply is functioning properly (if applicable).
- Test in controlled conditions to see if readings change.


  1. Causes of zero solar radiation readings in Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometers may include issues with wiring, incorrect measurement range, short circuits, water ingress, or sensor faults. Maintenance actions involve:
1. Inspecting and cleaning the dome regularly to ensure it is free of dirt, condensation, and ice.
2. Checking wiring connections and ensuring proper impedance across sensor wires.
3. Verifying the calibration factor entered in the data logger.
4. Recalibrating the sensor every two years as recommended by the manufacturer.
5. Conducting routine checks of the sensor output for signs of abnormalities.

  2. The Kipp & Zonen CMP3 solar radiation readings may show zero due to factors such as instrument malfunction, debris on the sensor, or incorrect installation. Maintenance actions include regular cleaning of the sensor, ensuring proper calibration, and checking for any physical obstructions that could affect the readings. Upgrading to newer models like the CMP6 or SMP6 may minimize maintenance needs, as they have improved designs for reliability and reduced maintenance requirements.


  1. The sensitivity and typical zero reading behavior of the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer can be affected by environmental factors such as low outer dome temperature, which may fall to the dew point. This can lead to dew or frost formation on the dome, causing erroneous measurements. If the sensor signal shows values like -9999 or around 0, it may indicate issues such as incorrect wiring, impedance problems, or sensor faults. Regular recalibration is recommended every two years to maintain accuracy.

  2. The operating range sensitivity for the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer is significant for accurate solar radiation measurements. Typical zero reading behavior indicates offsets due to thermal radiation and temperature changes, which should be accounted for in measurements. The zero offsets can include:

(a) thermal radiation (at 200 W/m²) 
(b) temperature change (5 K/h) 
(c) the total zero offset.

For reliable readings, it’s crucial to consider these factors within the sensitivity specifications defined by ISO 9060:2018.

Applications include solar monitoring for PV systems, where reliable Class B measurement of solar irradiance is essential.
