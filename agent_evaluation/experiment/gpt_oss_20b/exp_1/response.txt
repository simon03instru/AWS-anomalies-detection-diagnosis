At 2024‑08‑15 T03:30 UTC (10:30 ICT) the satellite‑derived data show a temperature of about 29 °C, relative humidity around 56 %, and direct solar radiation of roughly 431 W m⁻². The anomaly report lists a solar‑radiation reading of 0 W m⁻² at the same instant. The observed radiation is more than 400 W m⁻² higher than the anomalous value, indicating a clear sensor fault rather than a genuine atmospheric event.

The Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer’s operating range sensitivity is defined by ISO 9060:2018 and is affected by thermal radiation and temperature changes. Typical zero‑reading behavior is an offset caused by thermal radiation (~200 W m⁻²) and temperature drift (~5 K h⁻¹). A measured value of 0 W m⁻² during daylight is outside the normal operating range and usually indicates a sensor fault, wiring issue, or calibration problem. Therefore, the 0 W m⁻² reading is not within expected operational limits and warrants troubleshooting and recalibration.


Causes of zero solar radiation readings in a Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer include:
1. Wiring problems or short circuits.
2. Incorrect measurement range or calibration factor.
3. Water ingress or condensation inside the dome.
4. Physical obstructions such as dirt, ice, or debris on the sensor.
5. Sensor fault or internal failure.

Recommended maintenance actions:
1. Inspect and clean the sensor dome and optical window to remove dirt, ice, or condensation.
2. Check all wiring connections for integrity, proper impedance, and secure attachment.
3. Verify the calibration factor entered in the data logger matches the sensor’s specification.
4. Recalibrate the sensor every two years as per manufacturer guidance.
5. Perform routine output checks for abnormal signals and replace the sensor if faults persist.
6. If the sensor continues to give zero readings after cleaning, wiring, and recalibration, consider replacing the CMP3 with a newer model such as the CMP6 or SMP6 for improved reliability.
