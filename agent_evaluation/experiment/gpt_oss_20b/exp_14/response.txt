**Comprehensive Assessment of Wind Speed Anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA**

1. **Anomaly Summary**
   - Detected wind‑speed spike to 10.511 m/s at 2024‑08‑19 07:40 UTC.
   - 10‑minute mean was 1.8 m/s; spike is +8.7 m/s, >5σ, and a single‑interval outlier.
   - No expected negative correlation with surface pressure (993.7 hPa) was observed, suggesting a sensor fault rather than a meteorological event.

2. **Weather Context**
   - Satellite data for the same location and time shows a wind speed of ~20.1 m/s, temperature ~29 °C, relative humidity ~58 %.
   - The sensor’s reading is ~9.6 m/s lower than the satellite value, indicating significant under‑reporting.
   - The discrepancy is far beyond normal diurnal or gust variability, reinforcing the likelihood of a sensor or data‑logging issue.

3. **Sensor Operational Range & Sensitivity**
   - The Young 05103‑L wind‑speed sensor’s operational range and sensitivity limits are not explicitly documented in the provided knowledge base.
   - Without a datasheet, we cannot confirm that 10.511 m/s falls within its reliable measurement band.
   - However, the magnitude of the spike relative to the 10‑minute mean and the mismatch with satellite data strongly point to a malfunction.

4. **Maintenance & Troubleshooting Findings**
   - Common causes for sudden spikes in the Young 05103‑L include:
     1. Loose or incorrect wiring to the pulse channel.
     2. Coil resistance issues (open or shorted coil).
     3. Incorrect datalogger configuration (multiplier, offset, code).
     4. Data‑logger program table overruns.
     5. Mechanical wear (ball bearings, potentiometer).
     6. Electrical interference or grounding problems.
   - Recommended actions:
     * Inspect and secure all wiring; verify correct polarity.
     * Measure coil resistance (target ~2075 Ω); replace sensor if out of spec.
     * Verify datalogger configuration matches sensor specs.
     * Check for program table overruns and adjust logging intervals/buffer sizes.
     * Inspect mechanical components; replace worn bearings or clean/replace potentiometer.
     * Ensure proper grounding and shielding to reduce EMI.
     * Recalibrate the sensor after any adjustments.

5. **Immediate Recommendations**
   - Perform a quick visual inspection of wiring and connectors.
   - Measure coil resistance; if abnormal, replace the sensor.
   - Re‑configure the datalogger settings and clear any buffer overruns.
   - Temporarily disable the wind‑speed channel to prevent further erroneous data from contaminating the dataset.

6. **Long‑Term Recommendations**
   - Install a secondary, redundant wind‑speed sensor (e.g., an anemometer with a different measurement principle) to cross‑validate readings.
   - Implement automated anomaly detection that flags values >3σ from the 10‑minute mean and cross‑checks with satellite data.
   - Schedule quarterly maintenance checks: wiring inspection, coil resistance measurement, and mechanical wear assessment.
   - Maintain an up‑to‑date datasheet for the Young 05103‑L and any replacement units to ensure operational range is known.
   - Log and review all maintenance actions to build a trend of sensor reliability over time.

**Conclusion**
The wind‑speed anomaly is most plausibly caused by a sensor or data‑logging fault rather than a meteorological event. Immediate inspection and corrective actions, coupled with long‑term redundancy and monitoring, will restore reliable wind‑speed measurements and prevent recurrence.
