**Comprehensive Assessment & Action Plan for Anomaly at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit**

1. **Summary**
   - Anomaly detected: 51.0 mm rainfall spike at 2024‑08‑16 15:30:00.
   - Current weather (2025‑10‑29 11:50:13): 0 mm precipitation – vastly lower than the anomalous reading.
   - Confidence in fault: >80 %.

2. **Current Weather Conditions**
   - No rainfall recorded at the time of validation.
   - The 51 mm spike is inconsistent with the actual weather, indicating a likely sensor issue.

3. **Sensor Operational Assessment**
   - **Model**: HyQuest TB4 tipping‑bucket rain gauge.
   - **Operational range**: 0–100 mm h⁻¹ (max 700 mm h⁻¹).
   - **Accuracy**: ±2 %.
   - **Observed reading**: 51.0 mm – comfortably within the 0–100 mm h⁻¹ range.
   - **Sensitivity**: Adequate for detecting the observed trend.
   - **Conclusion**: The reading is within normal operational limits, but the sudden spike suggests a malfunction (e.g., blockage, debris, or mechanical fault).

4. **Maintenance & Troubleshooting Recommendations**
   - Inspect and clean the **catch filter**.
   - Clean the **siphon**.
   - Clean the interior of the **bucket**.
   - Clean the top surface of the **adjusting screws**.
   - Lightly lubricate the **enclosure locking screws** after cleaning.
   - Verify that the **tipping bucket assembly** moves freely.
   - Confirm that the **data logger** accurately records each bucket tip.
   - Check for and remove any **debris blocking the collector area**.

5. **Actionable Steps**
   1. Schedule a maintenance visit within 48 h.
   2. Perform the cleaning steps above.
   3. Run a calibration test to ensure the sensor reads 0 mm during dry conditions.
   4. Monitor the sensor for at least 24 h post‑maintenance to confirm normal operation.
   5. If anomalies persist, consider replacing the tipping bucket assembly.

**Conclusion**
The anomaly is most likely due to a sensor malfunction rather than an extreme weather event. Following the outlined maintenance steps should restore accurate rainfall measurements and prevent future false spikes.
