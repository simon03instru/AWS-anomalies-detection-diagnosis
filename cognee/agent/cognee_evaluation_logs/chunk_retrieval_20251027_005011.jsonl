If a switched 12V terminal is\nused, temporarily connect the red wire to a non-switched 12V terminal for test purposes.\nl Verify that the BaroVUE 10 SDI-12 address matches the address entered for the\nSDI12Recorder() instruction. The default address is 0. The address can be verified or\nchanged with the commands described in SDI-12 command basics (p. 32) or by using the\nDevice Configuration Utility (p. 21).\n\nMaintenance\nRequired maintenance includes regularly changing the desiccant and recalibrating the sensor\ncard. When the Enclosure Accessory Humidity Indicator Card changes from blue to pink, replace\nthe desiccant in the enclosure and, if applicable, the desiccant chamber.\nThe BaroVUE 10 calculates information about the quality of the measurement (see Quality metric\n[p. 19]). The quality metric gives information about the reliability of the data; a poor quality metric\nmay mean the data is unreliable, and the device should be sent to the factory for calibration.\nHowever, it is recommended that the sensor card be sent to Campbell Scientific for calibration\n\n\nSensor card replacement procedure\nCAUTION:\nThe BaroVUE 10 is sensitive to static when the main case is opened.

If the sensor malfunctions, replace it.\n\nADJUSTMENT AND CALIBRATION\nCalibration of the PTB110 series barometers is NIST traceable\nand the barometers are supplied with a NIST traceable\ncalibration certificate.\nThere are two push buttons available for the offset fine\nadjustment inside the barometer (see the figure on the previous\npage). The adjustment step is 0.05 hPa.\nOPERATING THE BUTTONS\nRestoring Adjustments\nTo restore the adjustments, press and hold down the left button\nwhile switching on the barometer. After releasing the button, a\ngreen LED starts flashing.\nWhen the factory adjustments are in use, the green LED flashes\ntwice. When the user adjustments are in use, the green LED\nflashes three times.\nNow you can change the factory adjustments to user adjustments\nor vice versa by pressing the left button.\nReturn to the normal operating mode by switching the power off\nand on in sequence.\nUsing Analog Output Test Mode\nTo activate the test mode, press and hold down the right button\nwhile switching on the barometer.\nThe function forces the voltage or frequency output to 50% of\nthe scale. As an indication of the test mode, the red LED is lit.\nReturn to the normal operating mode by switching the power off\nand on in sequence.\nOffset Correction\nTo activate the offset correction mode, press and hold down both\nbuttons switching on the barometer.\nThe green and red LEDs are lit.

If a switched 12V terminal is\nused, temporarily connect the red wire to a non-switched 12V terminal for test purposes.\nl Verify that the BaroVUE 10 SDI-12 address matches the address entered for the\nSDI12Recorder() instruction. The default address is 0. The address can be verified or\nchanged with the commands described in SDI-12 command basics (p. 32) or by using the\nDevice Configuration Utility (p. 21).\n\nMaintenance\nRequired maintenance includes regularly changing the desiccant and recalibrating the sensor\ncard. When the Enclosure Accessory Humidity Indicator Card changes from blue to pink, replace\nthe desiccant in the enclosure and, if applicable, the desiccant chamber.\nThe BaroVUE 10 calculates information about the quality of the measurement (see Quality metric\n[p. 19]). The quality metric gives information about the reliability of the data; a poor quality metric\nmay mean the data is unreliable, and the device should be sent to the factory for calibration.\nHowever, it is recommended that the sensor card be sent to Campbell Scientific for calibration\n\n\nSensor card replacement procedure\nCAUTION:\nThe BaroVUE 10 is sensitive to static when the main case is opened. To avoid damage, take\nadequate anti-static measures when handling.\n1. 2. Contact Campbell Scientific for your replacement sensor card. When received, take this\nnewly calibrated card with you to the site of the BaroVUE 10 installation.\nOpen the main case by unclipping the latch and opening the main door. See Figure 8-1 (p.\n21).\nl Sensor card plugs into the silver card socket mounted on the motherboard (see\nFigure 9-1 [p. 29]).\nl Correct sensor-card orientation is with card notch facing down (towards the\nmotherboard). The card revision number should be visible.\nCAUTION:\nthe slot.\nIf the sensor card is oriented incorrectly, it will not insert fully. Do not force the card into\nTo remove the sensor card, push the card down towards the socket then release. Spring\ntension pushes the sensor card out of the socket.\nNOTE:\nThe sensor card can be safely removed while the BaroVUE 10 is connected to power.\nStore the old sensor card in an electrostatic protective package and return it to Campbell\nScientific for recalibration or general servicing.\nUnpack the replacement sensor card, avoiding static discharges to the element by touching\nthe package before touching the element.\nCarefully align and insert the sensor card in the card socket on the motherboard.\nConfirm the correct orientation and gently push the sensor card into the socket until it\nclicks into place.\nBefore closing the main case, double-check that the card is inserted in the correct\norientation.

If a switched 12V terminal is\nused, temporarily connect the red wire to a non-switched 12V terminal for test purposes.\nl Verify that the BaroVUE 10 SDI-12 address matches the address entered for the\nSDI12Recorder() instruction. The default address is 0. The address can be verified or\nchanged with the commands described in SDI-12 command basics (p. 32) or by using the\nDevice Configuration Utility (p. 21).\n\nMaintenance\nRequired maintenance includes regularly changing the desiccant and recalibrating the sensor\ncard. When the Enclosure Accessory Humidity Indicator Card changes from blue to pink, replace\nthe desiccant in the enclosure and, if applicable, the desiccant chamber.\nThe BaroVUE 10 calculates information about the quality of the measurement (see Quality metric\n[p. 19]). The quality metric gives information about the reliability of the data; a poor quality metric\nmay mean the data is unreliable, and the device should be sent to the factory for calibration.\nHowever, it is recommended that the sensor card be sent to Campbell Scientific for calibration\n\n\nSensor card replacement procedure\nCAUTION:\nThe BaroVUE 10 is sensitive to static when the main case is opened. To avoid damage, take\nadequate anti-static measures when handling.\n1. 2. Contact Campbell Scientific for your replacement sensor card. When received, take this\nnewly calibrated card with you to the site of the BaroVUE 10 installation.\nOpen the main case by unclipping the latch and opening the main door. See Figure 8-1 (p.\n21).\nl Sensor card plugs into the silver card socket mounted on the motherboard (see\nFigure 9-1 [p. 29]).\nl Correct sensor-card orientation is with card notch facing down (towards the\nmotherboard). The card revision number should be visible.\nCAUTION:\nthe slot.\nIf the sensor card is oriented incorrectly, it will not insert fully. Do not force the card into\nTo remove the sensor card, push the card down towards the socket then release. Spring\ntension pushes the sensor card out of the socket.\nNOTE:\nThe sensor card can be safely removed while the BaroVUE 10 is connected to power.\nStore the old sensor card in an electrostatic protective package and return it to Campbell\nScientific for recalibration or general servicing.\nUnpack the replacement sensor card, avoiding static discharges to the element by touching\nthe package before touching the element.\nCarefully align and insert the sensor card in the card socket on the motherboard.\nConfirm the correct orientation and gently push the sensor card into the socket until it\nclicks into place.\nBefore closing the main case, double-check that the card is inserted in the correct\norientation.
