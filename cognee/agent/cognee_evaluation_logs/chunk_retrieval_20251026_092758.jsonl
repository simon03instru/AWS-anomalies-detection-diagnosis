When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.\nCAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.\n1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.\n2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.\nCAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.\n3. After removing the filter, check the O\u2011ring and change it if necessary.\n4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.\n5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.\n\nTroubleshooting\nSymptom: Relative Humidity is reported as \u20139999, NAN, \u201380 \u00b0C, or 0%\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the\nmeasurement instructions.\n2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is\ncorrect for the data logger type.\nVerify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the\nwire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.\nConnect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting\npurposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output\nvoltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively\n(temperature \u00b0C = mV * 0.14 \u2013 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).\nSymptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity\n1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger\nprogramming (p. 10)).\n\nMaintenance\nThe HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation\nshield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for\ncontaminates.\nWhen installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt\n(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an\naffinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the\nfilter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.\nThe filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed\nas well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.\nRecalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for\nthe procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.\n\nCleaning\nClean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.\nChanging the probe filter\n1. Remove the filter from the probe.\n2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.\n3. Install a new filter on the probe.\nNew filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.\n\n\nHygroVue Maintenance\n\nSyptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:\n\n1. Temperature is reported as\n\u20139999 or NAN, and relative\nhumidity is reported as 0 or\nan unchanging value.\n\nThis indicates a problem\nwith the SDI-12\ncommunications with the\nsensor.\n\nRecheck the sensor wiring.\nCheck the voltage to the sensor is 12V\nwith a digital voltage meter.\nVerify the sensor SDI-12 address\nmatches the address entered for the\nSDI12Recorder() instruction.\n\n2. Inaccurate temperature or\nrelative humidity is\nreported.\n\nInadequate delay after\npower-up (only applicable\nif using SW12)\nThe sensor element has\nbeen contaminated\nElectrical interference\n\nVerify the program is allowing a\npower-up time of at least 1.8 s.\nClean the sensor tip with distilled\nwater or replace it.\nEnsure the sensor is not installed too\nclose to a radio transmitter or cell\nphone.\n\n3. Temperature and relative\nhumidity read \u201399.999\n\nThis indicates a fault with\nthe sensor element itself or\ncommunication between\nthe sensor element and the\nelectronics in the sensor\nbody.\n\nCheck the sensor element is properly\nplugged in with the correct\norientation.\nCheck for water being present under\nthe sensor element connector and\nthere is no corrosion of the sensor\npins or the socket.\nSwap the element for another one.\n\n\nMaintenance\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter\ncap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If\ndirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is\nscrewed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers\u2014do not over tighten.\nCheck the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the\nshield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is\nneeded, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow\nthe shield to dry before remounting.\nCAUTION:\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect\nthe electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the\nsensor body\n\n\nCalibration\nThe life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own\nacceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner\nenvironments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the\nsensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell\nScientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively\nbrings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.\nIf you wish to check an old element\u2019s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it\ninto another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.\nNOTE:\nWe cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed\nevery yea\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "label": "pt100 temperature sensor", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "description": "Temperature sensor soldered to the HMP155 probe.", "name": "pt100 temperature sensor", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.2268610412703579}}, {"id": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "label": "hygrovue 10", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "description": "A sensor used for measuring temperature and humidity.", "name": "hygrovue 10", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.38417525585249507}}], "edges": [{"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "target": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["The Vaisala HMP155 sensor has a temperature measurement range of \u221280 to +60 \u00b0C (\u2212112 to +140 \u00b0F) and uses a Pt100 RTD element for temperature sensing.

A wet probe\nmay not give an accurate measurement\nin the ambient air.\nThis is an environment to which Vaisala\nhas designed this patented, warmed\nprobe for reliable measurements. As\nthe sensor head is warmed continuously,\nthe humidity level inside it stays below\nthe ambient level. Thus, it also reduces\nthe risk of condensation forming on\nthe probe.\nFast measurements\nWith its fast response time,\nthe additional temperature probe for\nHMP155 is ideal for measuring in\nenvironments with changing\ntemperatures. The membrane filter\nspeeds up the relative humidity\nmeasurement.\nLong lifetime\nProtecting the sensor from precipitation,\nand scattered and direct solar radiation\nincreases its lifetime.

Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.\n1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.\n2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.\nCAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.\n3. After removing the filter, check the O\u2011ring and change it if necessary.\n4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.\n5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.\n\nTroubleshooting\nSymptom: Relative Humidity is reported as \u20139999, NAN, \u201380 \u00b0C, or 0%\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the\nmeasurement instructions.\n2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is\ncorrect for the data logger type.\nVerify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the\nwire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.\nConnect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting\npurposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output\nvoltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively\n(temperature \u00b0C = mV * 0.14 \u2013 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).\nSymptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity\n1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger\nprogramming (p. 10)).\n\nMaintenance\nThe HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation\nshield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for\ncontaminates.\nWhen installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt\n(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an\naffinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the\nfilter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.\nThe filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed\nas well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.\nRecalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for\nthe procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.\n\nCleaning\nClean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.\nChanging the probe filter\n1. Remove the filter from the probe.\n2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.\n3. Install a new filter on the probe.\nNew filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.\n\n\nHygroVue Maintenance\n\nSyptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:\n\n1. Temperature is reported as\n\u20139999 or NAN, and relative\nhumidity is reported as 0 or\nan unchanging value.\n\nThis indicates a problem\nwith the SDI-12\ncommunications with the\nsensor.\n\nRecheck the sensor wiring.\nCheck the voltage to the sensor is 12V\nwith a digital voltage meter.\nVerify the sensor SDI-12 address\nmatches the address entered for the\nSDI12Recorder() instruction.\n\n2. Inaccurate temperature or\nrelative humidity is\nreported.\n\nInadequate delay after\npower-up (only applicable\nif using SW12)\nThe sensor element has\nbeen contaminated\nElectrical interference\n\nVerify the program is allowing a\npower-up time of at least 1.8 s.\nClean the sensor tip with distilled\nwater or replace it.\nEnsure the sensor is not installed too\nclose to a radio transmitter or cell\nphone.\n\n3. Temperature and relative\nhumidity read \u201399.999\n\nThis indicates a fault with\nthe sensor element itself or\ncommunication between\nthe sensor element and the\nelectronics in the sensor\nbody.\n\nCheck the sensor element is properly\nplugged in with the correct\norientation.\nCheck for water being present under\nthe sensor element connector and\nthere is no corrosion of the sensor\npins or the socket.\nSwap the element for another one.\n\n\nMaintenance\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter\ncap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If\ndirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is\nscrewed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers\u2014do not over tighten.\nCheck the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the\nshield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is\nneeded, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow\nthe shield to dry before remounting.\nCAUTION:\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect\nthe electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the\nsensor body\n\n\nCalibration\nThe life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own\nacceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner\nenvironments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the\nsensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell\nScientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively\nbrings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.\nIf you wish to check an old element\u2019s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it\ninto another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.\nNOTE:\nWe cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed\nevery yea\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "label": "pt100 temperature sensor", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "description": "Temperature sensor soldered to the HMP155 probe.", "name": "pt100 temperature sensor", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.2790734344988182}}, {"id": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "label": "hygrovue 10", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "description": "A sensor used for measuring temperature and humidity.", "name": "hygrovue 10", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.3882884901361879}}], "edges": [{"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "target": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["For troubleshooting abnormal temperature readings from the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, consider the following:\n\n1. **Installation Check**: Ensure the sensor is installed in a suitable environment, protected from direct solar radiation and precipitation by using appropriate radiation shields (DTR13, DTR503, or Stevenson screen).\n\n2. **Probe Condition**: Inspect the additional temperature probe for any damages and ensure it is clean and free from obstructions that may affect measurements.\n\n3. **Warming Issues**: If the humidity readings are abnormal during high humidity conditions, verify that the warmed probe is functioning correctly to prevent condensation, which can distort readings.\n\n4. **Calibration**: Calibrate the sensor using a computer with a USB cable or with the MI70 indicator to ensure accurate temperature readings.\n\n5. **Environmental Factors**: Note that readings may be unreliable if the temperature is fluctuating rapidly in the environment.

A wet probe\nmay not give an accurate measurement\nin the ambient air.\nThis is an environment to which Vaisala\nhas designed this patented, warmed\nprobe for reliable measurements.

Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.\nCAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.\n3. After removing the filter, check the O\u2011ring and change it if necessary.\n4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.\n5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.\n\nTroubleshooting\nSymptom: Relative Humidity is reported as \u20139999, NAN, \u201380 \u00b0C, or 0%\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the\nmeasurement instructions.\n2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is\ncorrect for the data logger type.\nVerify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the\nwire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.\nConnect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting\npurposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output\nvoltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively\n(temperature \u00b0C = mV * 0.14 \u2013 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).\nSymptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity\n1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger\nprogramming (p. 10)).\n\nMaintenance\nThe HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation\nshield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for\ncontaminates.\nWhen installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt\n(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an\naffinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the\nfilter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.\nThe filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed\nas well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.\nRecalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for\nthe procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.\n\nCleaning\nClean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.\nChanging the probe filter\n1. Remove the filter from the probe.\n2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.\n3. Install a new filter on the probe.\nNew filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.\n\n\nHygroVue Maintenance\n\nSyptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:\n\n1. Temperature is reported as\n\u20139999 or NAN, and relative\nhumidity is reported as 0 or\nan unchanging value.\n\nThis indicates a problem\nwith the SDI-12\ncommunications with the\nsensor.\n\nRecheck the sensor wiring.\nCheck the voltage to the sensor is 12V\nwith a digital voltage meter.\nVerify the sensor SDI-12 address\nmatches the address entered for the\nSDI12Recorder() instruction.\n\n2. Inaccurate temperature or\nrelative humidity is\nreported.\n\nInadequate delay after\npower-up (only applicable\nif using SW12)\nThe sensor element has\nbeen contaminated\nElectrical interference\n\nVerify the program is allowing a\npower-up time of at least 1.8 s.\nClean the sensor tip with distilled\nwater or replace it.\nEnsure the sensor is not installed too\nclose to a radio transmitter or cell\nphone.\n\n3. Temperature and relative\nhumidity read \u201399.999\n\nThis indicates a fault with\nthe sensor element itself or\ncommunication between\nthe sensor element and the\nelectronics in the sensor\nbody.\n\nCheck the sensor element is properly\nplugged in with the correct\norientation.\nCheck for water being present under\nthe sensor element connector and\nthere is no corrosion of the sensor\npins or the socket.\nSwap the element for another one.\n\n\nMaintenance\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter\ncap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If\ndirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is\nscrewed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers\u2014do not over tighten.\nCheck the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the\nshield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is\nneeded, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow\nthe shield to dry before remounting.\nCAUTION:\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect\nthe electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the\nsensor body\n\n\nCalibration\nThe life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own\nacceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner\nenvironments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the\nsensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell\nScientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively\nbrings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.\nIf you wish to check an old element\u2019s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it\ninto another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.\nNOTE:\nWe cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed\nevery yea\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "label": "pt100 temperature sensor", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "description": "Temperature sensor soldered to the HMP155 probe.", "name": "pt100 temperature sensor", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.1929872920006748}}, {"id": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "label": "hygrovue 10", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "description": "A sensor used for measuring temperature and humidity.", "name": "hygrovue 10", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.33421733196267234}}], "edges": [{"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "target": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["The Vaisala HMP155 sensor has a temperature range of \u221280 to +60 \u00b0C (\u2212112 to +140 \u00b0F).

A wet probe\nmay not give an accurate measurement\nin the ambient air.\nThis is an environment to which Vaisala\nhas designed this patented, warmed\nprobe for reliable measurements. As\nthe sensor head is warmed continuously,\nthe humidity level inside it stays below\nthe ambient level. Thus, it also reduces\nthe risk of condensation forming on\nthe probe.\nFast measurements\nWith its fast response time,\nthe additional temperature probe for\nHMP155 is ideal for measuring in\nenvironments with changing\ntemperatures. The membrane filter\nspeeds up the relative humidity\nmeasurement.\nLong lifetime\nProtecting the sensor from precipitation,\nand scattered and direct solar radiation\nincreases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala\nrecommends installing HMP155 in one of\nthe following radiation shields: DTR503,\nDTR13, or Stevenson screen. For\nthe additional temperature probe,\nan installation kit is available for Vaisala\nDTR502 Radiation Shield.\nCalibration\nThe probe can be calibrated using\na computer with a USB cable, with\nthe push buttons, or with the MI70\nindicator.\nVaisala HUMICAP\u00e2 Humidity and Temperature Probe\nHMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature\nmeasurement.

If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed\nas well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.\nRecalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for\nthe procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.\n\nCleaning\nClean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.\nChanging the probe filter\n1. Remove the filter from the probe.\n2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.\n3. Install a new filter on the probe.\nNew filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.\n\n\nHygroVue Maintenance\n\nSyptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:\n\n1. Temperature is reported as\n\u20139999 or NAN, and relative\nhumidity is reported as 0 or\nan unchanging value.\n\nThis indicates a problem\nwith the SDI-12\ncommunications with the\nsensor.\n\nRecheck the sensor wiring.\nCheck the voltage to the sensor is 12V\nwith a digital voltage meter.\nVerify the sensor SDI-12 address\nmatches the address entered for the\nSDI12Recorder() instruction.\n\n2. Inaccurate temperature or\nrelative humidity is\nreported.\n\nInadequate delay after\npower-up (only applicable\nif using SW12)\nThe sensor element has\nbeen contaminated\nElectrical interference\n\nVerify the program is allowing a\npower-up time of at least 1.8 s.\nClean the sensor tip with distilled\nwater or replace it.\nEnsure the sensor is not installed too\nclose to a radio transmitter or cell\nphone.\n\n3. Temperature and relative\nhumidity read \u201399.999\n\nThis indicates a fault with\nthe sensor element itself or\ncommunication between\nthe sensor element and the\nelectronics in the sensor\nbody.\n\nCheck the sensor element is properly\nplugged in with the correct\norientation.\nCheck for water being present under\nthe sensor element connector and\nthere is no corrosion of the sensor\npins or the socket.\nSwap the element for another one.\n\n\nMaintenance\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter\ncap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If\ndirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is\nscrewed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers\u2014do not over tighten.\nCheck the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the\nshield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is\nneeded, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow\nthe shield to dry before remounting.\nCAUTION:\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect\nthe electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the\nsensor body\n\n\nCalibration\nThe life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own\nacceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner\nenvironments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the\nsensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell\nScientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively\nbrings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.\nIf you wish to check an old element\u2019s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it\ninto another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.\nNOTE:\nWe cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed\nevery yea\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "a9f1cb43-c368-5f9a-8844-384ae7428f59", "label": "temperature_humidity__maintenance", "type": "TextDocument", "attributes": {"id": "a9f1cb43-c368-5f9a-8844-384ae7428f59", "description": null, "name": "temperature_humidity__maintenance", "type": "TextDocument", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "label": "hygrovue 10", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "description": "A sensor used for measuring temperature and humidity.", "name": "hygrovue 10", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.3990366275573116}}], "edges": [{"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "a9f1cb43-c368-5f9a-8844-384ae7428f59", "label": "is_part_of"}, {"source": "a9f1cb43-c368-5f9a-8844-384ae7428f59", "target": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "label": "is_part_of"}, {"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["To troubleshoot and maintain the Vaisala HMP155 sensor:\n1. **Calibration**: Regularly calibrate the sensor using a computer with a USB cable, push buttons, or an MI70 indicator to ensure measurement accuracy.\n2. **Sensor Protection**: Ensure the sensor is protected from precipitation and solar radiation by installing it in appropriate radiation shields like DTR503, DTR13, or Stevenson screen.\n3. **Warmed Probe Use**: In high humidity environments, use the warmed probe feature to prevent condensation on the sensor, which can distort measurements.\n4. **Check Connections**: Inspect the 8-pin male M12 connector and cables for any damage or wear that could affect the sensor's operation.\n5. **Response Time Monitoring**: Monitor the sensor's response time;

A wet probe\nmay not give an accurate measurement\nin the ambient air.\nThis is an environment to which Vaisala\nhas designed this patented, warmed\nprobe for reliable measurements. As\nthe sensor head is warmed continuously,\nthe humidity level inside it stays below\nthe ambient level. Thus, it also reduces\nthe risk of condensation forming on\nthe probe.\nFast measurements\nWith its fast response time,\nthe additional temperature probe for\nHMP155 is ideal for measuring in\nenvironments with changing\ntemperatures. The membrane filter\nspeeds up the relative humidity\nmeasurement.\nLong lifetime\nProtecting the sensor from precipitation,\nand scattered and direct solar radiation\nincreases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala\nrecommends installing HMP155 in one of\nthe following radiation shields: DTR503,\nDTR13, or Stevenson screen. For\nthe additional temperature probe,\nan installation kit is available for Vaisala\nDTR502 Radiation Shield.\nCalibration\nThe probe can be calibrated using\na computer with a USB cable, with\nthe push buttons, or with the MI70\nindicator.\nVaisala HUMICAP\u00e2 Humidity and Temperature Probe\nHMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature\nmeasurement.
