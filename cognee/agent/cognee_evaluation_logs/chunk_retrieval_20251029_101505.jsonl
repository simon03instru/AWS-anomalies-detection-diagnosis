Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count\ninstruction.\n2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the\nPulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.\nDisconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check\nof the switch.

Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and\nlifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).\n\n2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base\nSeparate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the\nsiphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).\nCAUTION:\nDo not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.\n\nDisassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):\na. Unscrew nut\nb. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body\nc. Remove stem from siphon body\nd. Unscrew cap\ne. Clean all items\n\nReassembling the rain bucket\n1. 2.

Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure\nthe housing onto the base.\n\nCalibration check\nThe sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the\nadjustment screws have loosened.\nNevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:\n1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting\nupward on the housing.\n2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.\n3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated\ncylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection\nfunnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).\n4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39\ntimes.\n5.

Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and\nlifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).\n\n2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base\nSeparate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the\nsiphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).\nCAUTION:\nDo not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.\n\nDisassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):\na.

Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting\nupward on the housing.\n2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.\n3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated\ncylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection\nfunnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).\n4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39\ntimes.\n5.

Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting\nupward on the housing.\n2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.\n3.
