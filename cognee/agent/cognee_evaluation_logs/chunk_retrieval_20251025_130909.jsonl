Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count\ninstruction.\n2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the\nPulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.\nDisconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check\nof the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket\nbetween the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket\nis tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.\nSymptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12\n1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and\nTable 7-3 [p. 10]).\n\nMaintenance\nDuring each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,\ndebris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.\nVerify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket\ntip.\nDismantling for cleaning\nRegularly check the following items for cleanliness:\nl Catch filter\nl Siphon\nl Interior of bucket\nl Top surface of adjusting screws\nl Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning\nl Insect screens\nTo access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:\n1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and\nlifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).\n\n2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base\nSeparate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the\nsiphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).\nCAUTION:\nDo not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.\n\nDisassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):\na. Unscrew nut\nb. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body\nc. Remove stem from siphon body\nd. Unscrew cap\ne. Clean all items\n\nReassembling the rain bucket\n1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).\nPush stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).\nReplace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).\nCAUTION:\nDo not over tighten.\nPush filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).\nCAUTION:\nDo not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.\n5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure\nthe housing onto the base.\n\nCalibration check\nThe sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the\nadjustment screws have loosened.\nNevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:\n1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting\nupward on the housing.\n2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.\n3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated\ncylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection\nfunnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).\n4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39\ntimes.\n5. If the rain gage fails to record the correct number of tips, return the unit to Campbell\nScientific for recalibration (see Assistance at the back of this manual).\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.05164695415606227}}, {"id": "18fd44f3-6b3a-5c7d-ab5d-c2e3f76a2897", "label": "tipping bucket taingauge model tb4", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "18fd44f3-6b3a-5c7d-ab5d-c2e3f76a2897", "description": "A model of a rainfall gauge manufactured by Hyquest Solutions.", "name": "tipping bucket taingauge model tb4", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.0}}], "edges": [{"source": "7843567b-14ca-590e-bbe3-fb2470170bd2", "target": "0aca771e-bcdb-5bda-b216-c5f08fb6d280", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "0aca771e-bcdb-5bda-b216-c5f08fb6d280", "target": "7843567b-14ca-590e-bbe3-fb2470170bd2", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "b8cf947e-bad2-5ebd-b05a-3f74ace95e55", "target": "18fd44f3-6b3a-5c7d-ab5d-c2e3f76a2897", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["**HyQuest TB4 Rainfall Sensor Specifications:**\n- **Operational Range:** Range of 700 mm per hour.\n- **Sensitivity:** \n  - 0-50 mm/hr: better than +/- 1% accuracy.\n  - 50-100 mm/hr: better than +/- 3%.\n  - 100-150 mm/hr: better than +/- 5%.\n  - 150-200 mm/hr: better than +/- 7%.\n  - 200-300 mm/hr: better than +/- 10%.\n\n**Vaisala HMP155 Humidity Sensor Specifications:**\nThe specifications for the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor are not provided in the given context; thus, specific details for operational range and sensitivity cannot be stated."], "chunks": null, "graph": null, "metadata": null, "score": null, "raw_data": {"search_result": ["**HyQuest TB4 Rainfall Sensor Specifications:**\n- **Operational Range:** Range of 700 mm per hour.\n- **Sensitivity:** \n  - 0-50 mm/hr: better than +/- 1% accuracy.\n  - 50-100 mm/hr: better than +/- 3%.\n  - 100-150 mm/hr: better than +/- 5%.\n  - 150-200 mm/hr: better than +/- 7%.\n  - 200-300 mm/hr: better than +/- 10%.\n\n**Vaisala HMP155 Humidity Sensor Specifications:**\nThe specifications for the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor are not provided in the given context; thus, specific details for operational range and sensitivity cannot be stated."], "dataset_id": "33aab9e8-73f0-588b-a15f-d24952b8e9bd", "dataset_name": "sensor_knowledge", "graphs": {"sensor_knowledge": {"nodes": [{"id": "03ee91d0-e64b-53e9-b541-43ba37bfeec0", "label": "", "type": "DocumentChunk", "attributes": {"id": "03ee91d0-e64b-53e9-b541-43ba37bfeec0", "description": null, "name": "", "type": "DocumentChunk", "text": "Page 1:\nGeneral Description\nHyQuest Solutions\u2019 TB6 is a non-syphoning \nhigh-quality tipping bucket rain gauge for \nmeasuring rainfall and precipitation in urban \nand rural locations.

Temperature and relative\nhumidity read \u201399.999\n\nThis indicates a fault with\nthe sensor element itself or\ncommunication between\nthe sensor element and the\nelectronics in the sensor\nbody.\n\nCheck the sensor element is properly\nplugged in with the correct\norientation.\nCheck for water being present under\nthe sensor element connector and\nthere is no corrosion of the sensor\npins or the socket.\nSwap the element for another one.\n\n\nMaintenance\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter\ncap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If\ndirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is\nscrewed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers\u2014do not over tighten.\nCheck the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the\nshield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is\nneeded, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow\nthe shield to dry before remounting.\nCAUTION:\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect\nthe electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the\nsensor body\n\n\nCalibration\nThe life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own\nacceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner\nenvironments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the\nsensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell\nScientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively\nbrings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.\nIf you wish to check an old element\u2019s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it\ninto another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.\nNOTE:\nWe cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed\nevery yea\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "label": "hygrovue 10", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "description": "A sensor used for measuring temperature and humidity.", "name": "hygrovue 10", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.27307206052342237}}], "edges": [{"source": "7843567b-14ca-590e-bbe3-fb2470170bd2", "target": "0aca771e-bcdb-5bda-b216-c5f08fb6d280", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "0aca771e-bcdb-5bda-b216-c5f08fb6d280", "target": "7843567b-14ca-590e-bbe3-fb2470170bd2", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["For troubleshooting sudden spikes and stuck readings in the HyQuest TB4 and Vaisala HMP155 probes, consider the following maintenance steps:\n\n1. **Check for Condensation**: Ensure that condensation is not affecting the sensor operation, especially in high humidity environments.

The membrane filter\nspeeds up the relative humidity\nmeasurement.\nLong lifetime\nProtecting the sensor from precipitation,\nand scattered and direct solar radiation\nincreases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala\nrecommends installing HMP155 in one of\nthe following radiation shields: DTR503,\nDTR13, or Stevenson screen. For\nthe additional temperature probe,\nan installation kit is available for Vaisala\nDTR502 Radiation Shield.\nCalibration\nThe probe can be calibrated using\na computer with a USB cable, with\nthe push buttons, or with the MI70\nindicator.\nVaisala HUMICAP\u00e2 Humidity and Temperature Probe\nHMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature\nmeasurement.
