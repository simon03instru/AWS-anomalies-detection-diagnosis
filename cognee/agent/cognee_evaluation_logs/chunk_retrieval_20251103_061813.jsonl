Remove accumulated dust,\ncondensation, or ice from the dome and pyranometer body by using a soft\ncloth dampened with water or alcohol (FIGURE 8-1).\n\u2022 The drying cartridge in the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 have orange and\nopaque desiccant granules (Section 8.1.1, Changing the Desiccant (p. 16)).\n\u2022 Mounting is secure.\n\u2022 Pyranometer is level or is at the correct angle.\n\u2022 Cables are in good condition.\n\nChanging the Desiccant\nThe CMP10 has an internal drying cartridge that will last for at least ten years\nif the housing is not opened. This significantly minimizes maintenance.\nThe drying cartridge of the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 uses desiccant that\nneeds to be periodically replaced. The silica gel desiccant granules in the\ndrying cartridge should be orange and opaque. Replace the desiccant granules\nwhen they become translucent (normally after several months). Refill packs of\ndesiccant are shipped with the pyranometer and can be purchased from\nCampbell Scientific. The drying cartridge uses the content of one refill pack.\nFIGURE 8-2 shows the replacement process.\nWhen changing the desiccant, ensure that:\n\u2022 Surfaces touching the rubber O-ring are clean. Dirt, in combination with\nwater, can cause corrosion, harming it.\n\u2022 Rubber O-ring is coated with silicon grease or petroleum jelly. The grease\ncoating improves the O-ring seal.\n\u2022 Drying cartridge is tightly threaded into the pyranometer body.\n\nCheck Sensor Output\nCheck the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a\nfault. However, several expected phenomena can cause strange measurements.\nIn particular, on clear, windless nights the outer dome temperature of\nhorizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as the dew point temperature\nof the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with the cold sky. (The effective\nsky temperature can be 30 \u00b0C lower than the ground temperature, which results\nin an infrared emission of \u2013150 W\u2022m\u20132). If this happens, dew, glazed frost or\nhoar frost can form on the top of the outer dome and can stay there for several\nhours in the morning. An ice cap on the dome is a strong diffuser and can\nincrease the pyranometer signal by up to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.\n\nRecalibration\nThe calibration of the pyranometer may drift with time and exposure to\nradiation. Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The\nsensor should be returned to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. Refer to the\nAssistance page for information on returning the pyranometer to Campbell\nScientific for recalibration.\n\nTroubleshooting\nSymptom: NAN, \u20139999, or radiation values around 0\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the differential terminal specified by the\nmeasurement instruction.\n2. Verify that the range code is correct for the data logger type.\n3. Measure the impedance across the white and black sensor wires. This\nshould be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1\nohm\u2022m\u20131). If the resistance is low, there may be a short circuit (check the\nwiring). Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water\ningress into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite,\nthere is a broken connection (check the wiring).\n4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.\nWith the sensor located 8 inches below a 60 W incandescent light bulb the\nvoltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a problem\nwith the sensor.\nSymptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low\n1.

Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the\ndata logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual\ncalibration factor.\n2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.\nSymptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations\n1. 2. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation\n(radar, radio).\nCheck the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.\n3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.\n\n\n\nCMP6, CMP10, CMP11, CMP21 Kipp and Zonen Maintenance\n\nMaintenance\nEvery week, physically inspect the pyranometer to ensure that:\n\u2022 Dome is free of dirt, condensation, and ice. Remove accumulated dust,\ncondensation, or ice from the dome and pyranometer body by using a soft\ncloth dampened with water or alcohol (FIGURE 8-1).\n\u2022 The drying cartridge in the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 have orange and\nopaque desiccant granules (Section 8.1.1, Changing the Desiccant (p. 16)).\n\u2022 Mounting is secure.\n\u2022 Pyranometer is level or is at the correct angle.\n\u2022 Cables are in good condition.\n\nChanging the Desiccant\nThe CMP10 has an internal drying cartridge that will last for at least ten years\nif the housing is not opened. This significantly minimizes maintenance.\nThe drying cartridge of the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 uses desiccant that\nneeds to be periodically replaced. The silica gel desiccant granules in the\ndrying cartridge should be orange and opaque. Replace the desiccant granules\nwhen they become translucent (normally after several months). Refill packs of\ndesiccant are shipped with the pyranometer and can be purchased from\nCampbell Scientific. The drying cartridge uses the content of one refill pack.\nFIGURE 8-2 shows the replacement process.\nWhen changing the desiccant, ensure that:\n\u2022 Surfaces touching the rubber O-ring are clean. Dirt, in combination with\nwater, can cause corrosion, harming it.\n\u2022 Rubber O-ring is coated with silicon grease or petroleum jelly. The grease\ncoating improves the O-ring seal.\n\u2022 Drying cartridge is tightly threaded into the pyranometer body.\n\nCheck Sensor Output\nCheck the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a\nfault. However, several expected phenomena can cause strange measurements.\nIn particular, on clear, windless nights the outer dome temperature of\nhorizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as the dew point temperature\nof the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with the cold sky. (The effective\nsky temperature can be 30 \u00b0C lower than the ground temperature, which results\nin an infrared emission of \u2013150 W\u2022m\u20132). If this happens, dew, glazed frost or\nhoar frost can form on the top of the outer dome and can stay there for several\nhours in the morning. An ice cap on the dome is a strong diffuser and can\nincrease the pyranometer signal by up to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.\n\nRecalibration\nThe calibration of the pyranometer may drift with time and exposure to\nradiation. Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The\nsensor should be returned to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. Refer to the\nAssistance page for information on returning the pyranometer to Campbell\nScientific for recalibration.\n\nTroubleshooting\nSymptom: NAN, \u20139999, or radiation values around 0\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the differential terminal specified by the\nmeasurement instruction.\n2. Verify that the range code is correct for the data logger type.\n3. Measure the impedance across the white and black sensor wires. This\nshould be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1\nohm\u2022m\u20131). If the resistance is low, there may be a short circuit (check the\nwiring). Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water\ningress into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite,\nthere is a broken connection (check the wiring).\n4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.\nWith the sensor located 8 inches below a 60 W incandescent light bulb the\nvoltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a problem\nwith the sensor.\nSymptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low\n1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the\ndata logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual\ncalibration factor.\n2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.\nSymptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations\n1. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation,\nsuch as radar or radio interference.\n2. Check the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.\n3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "6e10c1bc-dfde-5a5c-87f5-98c8b985c438", "label": "cmp3 kipp and zonen pyranometer", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "6e10c1bc-dfde-5a5c-87f5-98c8b985c438", "description": "A pyranometer used to measure solar radiation.", "name": "cmp3 kipp and zonen pyranometer", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "b08decb0-b1ba-573d-87aa-72a63e77d39c", "label": "cmp21 kipp and zonen pyranometer", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "b08decb0-b1ba-573d-87aa-72a63e77d39c", "description": "A pyranometer used to measure solar radiation.", "name": "cmp21 kipp and zonen pyranometer", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.036678754362391895}}, {"id": "b5177cac-fd01-5785-a2d5-0a3dd7fe7464", "label": "cmp11 kipp and zonen pyranometer", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "b5177cac-fd01-5785-a2d5-0a3dd7fe7464", "description": "A pyranometer used to measure solar radiation.", "name": "cmp11 kipp and zonen pyranometer", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.039927721816919316}}], "edges": [{"source": "4d319e84-be68-58b5-ab90-7b1a30d7bc41", "target": "6e10c1bc-dfde-5a5c-87f5-98c8b985c438", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "6e10c1bc-dfde-5a5c-87f5-98c8b985c438", "target": "4d319e84-be68-58b5-ab90-7b1a30d7bc41", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "4d319e84-be68-58b5-ab90-7b1a30d7bc41", "target": "b08decb0-b1ba-573d-87aa-72a63e77d39c", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "b08decb0-b1ba-573d-87aa-72a63e77d39c", "target": "4d319e84-be68-58b5-ab90-7b1a30d7bc41", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "4d319e84-be68-58b5-ab90-7b1a30d7bc41", "target": "b5177cac-fd01-5785-a2d5-0a3dd7fe7464", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["To troubleshoot the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 communication failure with a sentinel reading of -9999, follow these diagnostic steps:\n\n1. **Check Connections:** Ensure that all wiring and connectors are intact, secure, and free of corrosion.\n2. **Inspect Power Supply:** Verify that the device is properly powered.
