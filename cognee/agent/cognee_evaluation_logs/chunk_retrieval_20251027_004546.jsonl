If the sensor malfunctions, replace it.\n\nADJUSTMENT AND CALIBRATION\nCalibration of the PTB110 series barometers is NIST traceable\nand the barometers are supplied with a NIST traceable\ncalibration certificate.\nThere are two push buttons available for the offset fine\nadjustment inside the barometer (see the figure on the previous\npage). The adjustment step is 0.05 hPa.\nOPERATING THE BUTTONS\nRestoring Adjustments\nTo restore the adjustments, press and hold down the left button\nwhile switching on the barometer. After releasing the button, a\ngreen LED starts flashing.\nWhen the factory adjustments are in use, the green LED flashes\ntwice. When the user adjustments are in use, the green LED\nflashes three times.\nNow you can change the factory adjustments to user adjustments\nor vice versa by pressing the left button.\nReturn to the normal operating mode by switching the power off\nand on in sequence.\nUsing Analog Output Test Mode\nTo activate the test mode, press and hold down the right button\nwhile switching on the barometer.\nThe function forces the voltage or frequency output to 50% of\nthe scale. As an indication of the test mode, the red LED is lit.\nReturn to the normal operating mode by switching the power off\nand on in sequence.\nOffset Correction\nTo activate the offset correction mode, press and hold down both\nbuttons switching on the barometer.\nThe green and red LEDs are lit.

If a switched 12V terminal is\nused, temporarily connect the red wire to a non-switched 12V terminal for test purposes.\nl Verify that the BaroVUE 10 SDI-12 address matches the address entered for the\nSDI12Recorder() instruction. The default address is 0. The address can be verified or\nchanged with the commands described in SDI-12 command basics (p. 32) or by using the\nDevice Configuration Utility (p. 21).\n\nMaintenance\nRequired maintenance includes regularly changing the desiccant and recalibrating the sensor\ncard. When the Enclosure Accessory Humidity Indicator Card changes from blue to pink, replace\nthe desiccant in the enclosure and, if applicable, the desiccant chamber.\nThe BaroVUE 10 calculates information about the quality of the measurement (see Quality metric\n[p. 19]). The quality metric gives information about the reliability of the data; a poor quality metric\nmay mean the data is unreliable, and the device should be sent to the factory for calibration.\nHowever, it is recommended that the sensor card be sent to Campbell Scientific for calibration\n\n\nSensor card replacement procedure\nCAUTION:\nThe BaroVUE 10 is sensitive to static when the main case is opened. To avoid damage, take\nadequate anti-static measures when handling.\n1. 2. Contact Campbell Scientific for your replacement sensor card. When received, take this\nnewly calibrated card with you to the site of the BaroVUE 10 installation.\nOpen the main case by unclipping the latch and opening the main door. See Figure 8-1 (p.\n21).\nl Sensor card plugs into the silver card socket mounted on the motherboard (see\nFigure 9-1 [p. 29]).\nl Correct sensor-card orientation is with card notch facing down (towards the\nmotherboard). The card revision number should be visible.\nCAUTION:\nthe slot.\nIf the sensor card is oriented incorrectly, it will not insert fully. Do not force the card into\nTo remove the sensor card, push the card down towards the socket then release. Spring\ntension pushes the sensor card out of the socket.\nNOTE:\nThe sensor card can be safely removed while the BaroVUE 10 is connected to power.\nStore the old sensor card in an electrostatic protective package and return it to Campbell\nScientific for recalibration or general servicing.\nUnpack the replacement sensor card, avoiding static discharges to the element by touching\nthe package before touching the element.\nCarefully align and insert the sensor card in the card socket on the motherboard.\nConfirm the correct orientation and gently push the sensor card into the socket until it\nclicks into place.\nBefore closing the main case, double-check that the card is inserted in the correct\norientation.

Check monthly to make sure the radiation\nshield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for\ncontaminates.\nWhen installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt\n(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an\naffinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the\nfilter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.\nThe filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed\nas well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.\nRecalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for\nthe procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.\n\nCleaning\nClean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.\nChanging the probe filter\n1. Remove the filter from the probe.\n2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.\n3.

Temperature is reported as\n\u20139999 or NAN, and relative\nhumidity is reported as 0 or\nan unchanging value.\n\nThis indicates a problem\nwith the SDI-12\ncommunications with the\nsensor.\n\nRecheck the sensor wiring.\nCheck the voltage to the sensor is 12V\nwith a digital voltage meter.\nVerify the sensor SDI-12 address\nmatches the address entered for the\nSDI12Recorder() instruction.\n\n2. Inaccurate temperature or\nrelative humidity is\nreported.\n\nInadequate delay after\npower-up (only applicable\nif using SW12)\nThe sensor element has\nbeen contaminated\nElectrical interference\n\nVerify the program is allowing a\npower-up time of at least 1.8 s.\nClean the sensor tip with distilled\nwater or replace it.\nEnsure the sensor is not installed too\nclose to a radio transmitter or cell\nphone.\n\n3. Temperature and relative\nhumidity read \u201399.999\n\nThis indicates a fault with\nthe sensor element itself or\ncommunication between\nthe sensor element and the\nelectronics in the sensor\nbody.\n\nCheck the sensor element is properly\nplugged in with the correct\norientation.\nCheck for water being present under\nthe sensor element connector and\nthere is no corrosion of the sensor\npins or the socket.\nSwap the element for another one.\n\n\nMaintenance\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter\ncap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If\ndirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is\nscrewed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers\u2014do not over tighten.\nCheck the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the\nshield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is\nneeded, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow\nthe shield to dry before remounting.\nCAUTION:\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect\nthe electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the\nsensor body\n\n\nCalibration\nThe life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own\nacceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner\nenvironments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the\nsensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell\nScientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively\nbrings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.\nIf you wish to check an old element\u2019s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it\ninto another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.\nNOTE:\nWe cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed\nevery yea\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "label": "hygrovue 10", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "description": "A sensor used for measuring temperature and humidity.", "name": "hygrovue 10", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.17705437183752973}}, {"id": "b30869a7-9e24-5a67-a917-9c74ea4b62a2", "label": "measurement instructions", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "b30869a7-9e24-5a67-a917-9c74ea4b62a2", "description": "Instructions detailing how to measure using the HMP155 and HygroVue 10.", "name": "measurement instructions", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.5447556169361367}}], "edges": [{"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "target": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "b30869a7-9e24-5a67-a917-9c74ea4b62a2", "target": "9aabe8c8-bd6c-5470-a081-7374b4b7ebdc", "label": "provides_instructions"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["To troubleshoot zero humidity reading issues with the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, consider the following maintenance procedures:\n\n1. **Check the Sensor Environment**: Ensure that the sensor is not experiencing conditions that can affect readings, such as fog, mist, rain, or heavy dew.
