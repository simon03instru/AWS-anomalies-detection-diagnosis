The TB6 is the device of \nchoice for accurately measuring low rainfall \nevents (0-50 mm/hr with better than +/-1 % \naccuracy), because the water passes through \nthe nozzle and enters the bucket directly al-\nlowing small rainfall events to be measured. \nThe TB6\u2019s tried and proven design ensures \nlong-term, accurate and repeatable results. \nIt is manufactured from high quality, dura-\nble materials ensuring long term stability in \nthe harshest of environments. It consists of \na robust powder-coated aluminium enclo-\nsure, a UV-resistant ASA polymer base, and \nstainless steel fasteners and \ufb01  nger \ufb01  lter. \nEasy maintenance\nRemoval of the outer enclosure and access \nto the tipping bucket mechanism and \ufb01  nger \n\ufb01  lter assembly is made easy with quick \nrelease fasteners. The \ufb01  nger \ufb01  lter can be \nremoved easily during a \ufb01  eld service. It \nensures the collector catch area remains \nunblocked when leaves, bird droppings and \nother debris \ufb01  nd their way into the catch.\nThe TB6\u2019s base incorporates two water \noutlets at the bottom allowing for wa-\nter collection and data veri\ufb01  cation.\nOutput options\nTB6 includes a dual output 24 V DC \nreed switch allowing for output redun-\ndancy or the addition of a second data \nlogger. The second output could also be \nused for connecting HyQuest Solutions\u2019 \ncurrent meter counter CMCbt paired \nwith the free FCD application that allow \nfor easy and accurate \ufb01  eld calibration \neven in noisy (urban) environments. The \nreed switch incorporates varistor protection \nagainst surges that may be induced on long, \ninappropriately shielded signal cables.\nMain Features\n \uf06e Standard 200 mm diameter catch\n \uf06e Long term stable calibration\n \uf06e Minimal maintenance required\n \uf06e Robust design for all environments\n \uf06e Optional: autonomous real-time rain \nmonitoring and reporting system \nRainTrak Undercover with in-built telem-\netry and logging (see \ufb02  ip side)\nTB6 Rain Gauge\nTipping Bucket Rain Gauge\nMETEOROLOGY | PRECIPITATION | RAINFALL\nMONITORING\nAlternative Models TB3 and TB4\nIndustry-grade HS tipping buckets TB3 and TB4 are equipped with an integrated \nsyphon mechanism which delivers high levels of accuracy across a broad range of \nrainfall intensities. \n\nPage 2:\n HyQuest Solutions Europe\n\uf1ad Pascalstr. 8+10 | 52076 Aachen - Germany\n\uf095 +49 2408 9385 0 \n\uf0e0 info@hyquestsolutions.eu\n\uf0ac www.hyquestsolutions.eu\n HyQuest Solutions Australia \n\uf095 +61 2 9601 2022 \n\uf0e0 sales@hyquestsolutions.com.au\n\uf0ac www.hyquestsolutions.com\nContact Us\n HyQuest Solutions New Zealand \n\uf095 +64 (0)7 857 0810 \n\uf0e0 sales@hyquestsolutions.co.nz\n\uf0ac www.hyquestsolutions.com\nReseller\nTechnical Speci\ufb01  cations\nResolution 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, and 0.01 inch\nAccuracy \uf06e 0-100 mm per hour: better than       +/-2 %\n\uf06e 100-150 mm per hour: better than   +/-4 %\n\uf06e 150-200 mm per hour: better than   +/-5 %\n\uf06e     0-50 mm per hour: better than    +/-1 %\n\uf06e   \n50-100 mm per hour: better than     -3 %\n\uf06e 100-150mm per hour: better than      -5 %\n\uf06e 150-200 mm per hour: better than     -7 %\n\uf06e 200-300 mm per hour: better than   -10 %\nRange 700 mm per hour\nMaterial \uf06e Enclosure: powder-coated aluminium\n\uf06e Base: UV-resistant ASA\n\uf06e Bucket: chrome plated ASA\nPivots Sapphire tipped \nHeight & Mass 330 mm, 2.1 kg\nEnvironmental Conditions Operating Temperature Range: +4 \u00b0C to +7O \u00b0C; Humidity: O - 100 %\nAutonomous System \nRainTrak Undercover: TB6 \ncan be used as a component \nof the RainTrak to provide \na reliable and autonomous \nreal-time rain monitoring and \nreporting system.
