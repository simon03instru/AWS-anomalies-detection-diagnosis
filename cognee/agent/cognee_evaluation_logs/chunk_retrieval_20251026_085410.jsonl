When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.\nCAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.\n1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.\n2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.\nCAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.\n3. After removing the filter, check the O\u2011ring and change it if necessary.\n4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.\n5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.\n\nTroubleshooting\nSymptom: Relative Humidity is reported as \u20139999, NAN, \u201380 \u00b0C, or 0%\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the\nmeasurement instructions.\n2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is\ncorrect for the data logger type.\nVerify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the\nwire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.\nConnect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting\npurposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output\nvoltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively\n(temperature \u00b0C = mV * 0.14 \u2013 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).\nSymptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity\n1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger\nprogramming (p. 10)).\n\nMaintenance\nThe HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation\nshield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for\ncontaminates.\nWhen installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt\n(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an\naffinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the\nfilter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.\nThe filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed\nas well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.\nRecalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for\nthe procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.\n\nCleaning\nClean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.\nChanging the probe filter\n1. Remove the filter from the probe.\n2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.\n3. Install a new filter on the probe.\nNew filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.\n\n\nHygroVue Maintenance\n\nSyptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:\n\n1. Temperature is reported as\n\u20139999 or NAN, and relative\nhumidity is reported as 0 or\nan unchanging value.\n\nThis indicates a problem\nwith the SDI-12\ncommunications with the\nsensor.\n\nRecheck the sensor wiring.\nCheck the voltage to the sensor is 12V\nwith a digital voltage meter.\nVerify the sensor SDI-12 address\nmatches the address entered for the\nSDI12Recorder() instruction.\n\n2. Inaccurate temperature or\nrelative humidity is\nreported.\n\nInadequate delay after\npower-up (only applicable\nif using SW12)\nThe sensor element has\nbeen contaminated\nElectrical interference\n\nVerify the program is allowing a\npower-up time of at least 1.8 s.\nClean the sensor tip with distilled\nwater or replace it.\nEnsure the sensor is not installed too\nclose to a radio transmitter or cell\nphone.\n\n3. Temperature and relative\nhumidity read \u201399.999\n\nThis indicates a fault with\nthe sensor element itself or\ncommunication between\nthe sensor element and the\nelectronics in the sensor\nbody.\n\nCheck the sensor element is properly\nplugged in with the correct\norientation.\nCheck for water being present under\nthe sensor element connector and\nthere is no corrosion of the sensor\npins or the socket.\nSwap the element for another one.\n\n\nMaintenance\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter\ncap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If\ndirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is\nscrewed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers\u2014do not over tighten.\nCheck the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the\nshield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is\nneeded, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow\nthe shield to dry before remounting.\nCAUTION:\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect\nthe electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the\nsensor body\n\n\nCalibration\nThe life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own\nacceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner\nenvironments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the\nsensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell\nScientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively\nbrings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.\nIf you wish to check an old element\u2019s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it\ninto another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.\nNOTE:\nWe cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed\nevery yea\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "a9f1cb43-c368-5f9a-8844-384ae7428f59", "label": "temperature_humidity__maintenance", "type": "TextDocument", "attributes": {"id": "a9f1cb43-c368-5f9a-8844-384ae7428f59", "description": null, "name": "temperature_humidity__maintenance", "type": "TextDocument", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "a5cef0a0-f321-5298-94a0-9c4616d7be28", "label": "hmp155", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "a5cef0a0-f321-5298-94a0-9c4616d7be28", "description": "A probe used for measuring temperature and humidity.", "name": "hmp155", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.4053798998866612}}], "edges": [{"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "a9f1cb43-c368-5f9a-8844-384ae7428f59", "label": "is_part_of"}, {"source": "a9f1cb43-c368-5f9a-8844-384ae7428f59", "target": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "label": "is_part_of"}, {"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "a5cef0a0-f321-5298-94a0-9c4616d7be28", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["The Vaisala HMP155 has an operational range for humidity measurement of 0 to 100 %RH and a temperature measurement range of -80 to +60 \u00b0C (-112 to +140 \u00b0F).

When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.\nCAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.\n1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.\n2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.\nCAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.\n3. After removing the filter, check the O\u2011ring and change it if necessary.\n4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.\n5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.\n\nTroubleshooting\nSymptom: Relative Humidity is reported as \u20139999, NAN, \u201380 \u00b0C, or 0%\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the\nmeasurement instructions.\n2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is\ncorrect for the data logger type.\nVerify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the\nwire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.\nConnect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting\npurposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output\nvoltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively\n(temperature \u00b0C = mV * 0.14 \u2013 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).\nSymptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity\n1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger\nprogramming (p. 10)).\n\nMaintenance\nThe HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation\nshield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for\ncontaminates.\nWhen installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt\n(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an\naffinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the\nfilter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.\nThe filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed\nas well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.\nRecalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for\nthe procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.\n\nCleaning\nClean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.\nChanging the probe filter\n1. Remove the filter from the probe.\n2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.\n3. Install a new filter on the probe.\nNew filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.\n\n\nHygroVue Maintenance\n\nSyptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:\n\n1. Temperature is reported as\n\u20139999 or NAN, and relative\nhumidity is reported as 0 or\nan unchanging value.\n\nThis indicates a problem\nwith the SDI-12\ncommunications with the\nsensor.\n\nRecheck the sensor wiring.\nCheck the voltage to the sensor is 12V\nwith a digital voltage meter.\nVerify the sensor SDI-12 address\nmatches the address entered for the\nSDI12Recorder() instruction.\n\n2. Inaccurate temperature or\nrelative humidity is\nreported.\n\nInadequate delay after\npower-up (only applicable\nif using SW12)\nThe sensor element has\nbeen contaminated\nElectrical interference\n\nVerify the program is allowing a\npower-up time of at least 1.8 s.\nClean the sensor tip with distilled\nwater or replace it.\nEnsure the sensor is not installed too\nclose to a radio transmitter or cell\nphone.\n\n3. Temperature and relative\nhumidity read \u201399.999\n\nThis indicates a fault with\nthe sensor element itself or\ncommunication between\nthe sensor element and the\nelectronics in the sensor\nbody.\n\nCheck the sensor element is properly\nplugged in with the correct\norientation.\nCheck for water being present under\nthe sensor element connector and\nthere is no corrosion of the sensor\npins or the socket.\nSwap the element for another one.\n\n\nMaintenance\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter\ncap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If\ndirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is\nscrewed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers\u2014do not over tighten.\nCheck the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the\nshield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is\nneeded, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow\nthe shield to dry before remounting.\nCAUTION:\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect\nthe electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the\nsensor body\n\n\nCalibration\nThe life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own\nacceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner\nenvironments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the\nsensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell\nScientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively\nbrings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.\nIf you wish to check an old element\u2019s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it\ninto another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.\nNOTE:\nWe cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed\nevery yea\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "a9f1cb43-c368-5f9a-8844-384ae7428f59", "label": "temperature_humidity__maintenance", "type": "TextDocument", "attributes": {"id": "a9f1cb43-c368-5f9a-8844-384ae7428f59", "description": null, "name": "temperature_humidity__maintenance", "type": "TextDocument", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "label": "pt100 temperature sensor", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "description": "Temperature sensor soldered to the HMP155 probe.", "name": "pt100 temperature sensor", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.3920833077532742}}], "edges": [{"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "a9f1cb43-c368-5f9a-8844-384ae7428f59", "label": "is_part_of"}, {"source": "a9f1cb43-c368-5f9a-8844-384ae7428f59", "target": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "label": "is_part_of"}, {"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["To troubleshoot a sudden drop in temperature readings from the Vaisala HMP155, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Check for External Factors:** Ensure there are no environmental changes affecting the probe, such as direct exposure to fog, mist, or heavy dew, which can lead to inaccurate readings due to moisture on the sensor.\n\n2. **Examine Installation:** Ensure the probe is installed in a suitable location, such as within a radiation shield (DTR503, DTR13, or Stevenson screen) to protect against precipitation and solar radiation.\n\n3. **Probe Condition:** Inspect the sensor for any signs of damage or blockage.
