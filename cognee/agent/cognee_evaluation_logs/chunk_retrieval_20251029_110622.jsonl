Young Wind Monitor maintenance\nPreventive maintenance for R.M. Young Wind Monitor includes:\n\n-Checking the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer at least every second year. If the bearings are noisy or wind speed threshold increases above an acceptable level, replace the bearings.\nAfter replacing the bearings, update the maintenance information in the Web UI.\n-If the sensor measurement data looks suspicious after the maintenance operation, recalibrate the sensor.\nR.M. Young suggests that the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer be\ninspected at least every 24 months. Only a qualified technician should perform\nthe replacement.\nTroubleshooting\n7.1 Wind Direction\nSymptom: -9999 or no change in direction\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Excitation and Single-Ended channel\nspecified by the measurement instruction.\n2. Verify that the excitation voltage and Range code are correct for the\ndatalogger type.\n3. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohn meter to check the\npotentiometer. Resistance should be about 10K ohms between the Blue and\nWhite wires. The resistance between either the Blue/Green or White/Green\nwires should vary between 1K to 11K depending on the vane position.\nResistance when the vane is in the 5 degree dead band should be about 1 M\nohm.\nSymptom: Incorrect wind direction\n1. Verify that the Excitation voltage, Range code, multiplier and offset\nparameters are correct for the datalogger type.\n2. Check orientation of sensor, as described in Section 3.\n7.2 Wind Speed\nSymptom: No wind speed\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Pulse channel specified by the Pulse\ncount instruction.\n2. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohm meter to check\nthe coil. The resistance between the red and black wires should be about 2075\nohms.

The motor may be set to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise at any rate between 200 and \n15,000 RPM in 100 RPM increments. The LCD display is referenced to an accurate and stable quartz timebase. \nFor completely portable operation, the unit can be operated on internal batteries. For extended operation, an \nAC wall adapter is included.\nModel 18811 Anemometer Drive is identical to Model 18802 except the drive motor incorporates a \ngear reducer for operation in the range of 20 to 990 RPM in 10 RPM increments. The lower range \nis recommended for cup anemometer calibration.\nModel 18112 Vane Angle Bench Stand is used for benchtop wind direction calibration of the Wind Monitor \nfamily of sensors. The mounting post engages the direction orientation notch on the Wind Monitor. An easy to \nread pointer indicates 0 to 360 degrees with 1/2 degree resolution.\nModel 18212 Vane Angle Fixture - Tower Mount similar to the Model 18112, the tower mount feature allows use \non the tower as well as the bench top. The fixture is temporarily placed on the tower between the Wind Monitor \nand its tower mounting. Index keys and notches are engaged to preserve direction reference.\nModel 18310 Propeller Torque Disc checks anemometer bearing torque with 0.1 gm/cm resolu-\ntion. The disc temporarily replaces the propeller for torque measurement or simple yet accurate pass/fail \nchecks. Charts included with the unit relate torque to propeller threshold with limits for acceptable \nbearing performance.\nModel 18312 Cup-Wheel Torque Disc checks cup anemometer bearing torque.\nModel 18331 Vane Torque Gauge checks vane bearing torque of the Wind Monitor family sensors. Slip the \nfixture over the main housing and make simple yet accurate vane torque measurements. Charts relating vane \ntorque to vane threshold provide limits for acceptable bearing performance.\nModel 18301 Vane Alignment Rod helps align the vane of a wind sensor to a known direction reference during \ninstallation. The base of the device has an index key that engages the direction orientation notch in the sensor \nallowing the sensor to be removed without losing wind direction reference.\nSpecifications subject to change without notice. \nYOUNG\n Specifications\n Ordering Information                                                                  MODEL\nR.M.

YOUNG COMPANY   2801 AERO PARK DRIVE,  TRAVERSE CITY,  MICHIGAN 49686, USA\nTEL: (231) 946-3980      FAX: (231) 946-4772      WEB: www.youngusa.com \nPN: 05103-90\n REV: N062819\nWIND MONITOR\nMODEL 05103\n\nPage 2:\nPage 1\n05103-90(N)\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Wind Monitor measures horizontal wind speed and direction.  \nOriginally developed for ocean data buoy use, it is rugged and \ncorrosion resistant yet accurate and light weight. The main housing, \nnose cone, propeller, and other internal parts are injection molded \nU.V. stabilized plastic. Both the propeller and vertical shafts use \nstainless steel precision grade ball bearings.  Bearings have light \ncontacting teflon seals and are filled with a wide temperature range \ngrease to help exclude contamination and moisture.\nPropeller rotation produces an AC sine wave signal with frequency \nproportional to wind speed. This AC signal is induced in a \nstationary coil by a six pole magnet mounted on the propeller \nshaft. Three complete sine wave cycles are produced for each \npropeller revolution.\nVane position is transmitted by a 10K ohm precision conductive \nplastic potentiometer which requires a regulated excitation \nvoltage. With a constant voltage applied to the potentiometer, \nthe output signal is an analog voltage directly proportional to \nwind  direction angle.\nThe instrument mounts on standard one inch pipe, outside diameter \n34 mm (1.34\"). An orientation ring is provided so the instrument \ncan be removed for maintenance and reinstalled without loss of \nwind direction reference. Both the mounting post assembly and \nthe orientation ring are secured to the mounting pipe by stainless \nsteel band clamps. Electrical connections are made in a junction \nbox at the base. A variety of devices are available for signal \nconditioning, display, and recording of wind speed and direction.  \nINITIAL CHECKOUT\nWhen the Wind Monitor is unpacked it should be checked carefully \nfor any signs of shipping damage.  \nRemove the plastic nut on the propeller shaft. Install the propeller \non the shaft so the serial number on the propeller faces forward \n(into the wind). Engage the propeller into the molded ribs on the \npropeller shaft hub. The instrument is aligned, balanced and fully \ncalibrated before shipment, however, it should be checked both \nmechanically and electrically before installation. The vane and \npropeller should easily rotate 360\u00b0 without friction. Check vane \nbalance by holding the instrument base so the vane surface is \nhorizontal. It should have near neutral torque without any particular \ntendency to rotate. A slight imbalance will not degrade performance.\nThe potentiometer requires a stable DC excitation voltage.  Do \nnot exceed 15 volts. When the potentiometer wiper is in the 5\u00b0 \ndeadband region, the output signal is \"floating\" and may show \nvarying or unpredictable values. To prevent false readings,  signal \nconditioning electronics should clamp the signal to excitation \nor reference level when this occurs. NOTE: Young signal \nconditioning devices clamp the signal to excitation level. Avoid \na short circuit between the wind direction signal line and either the \nexcitation or reference lines. Although there is a 1K ohm current \nlimiting resistor in series with the wiper for protection, damage \nto the potentiometer may occur if a short circuit condition exists.\nBefore installation, connect the instrument to an indicator as shown \nin the wiring diagram and check for proper wind speed and wind \ndirection values. To check wind speed, temporarily remove the \npropeller and connect the shaft to an Anemometer Drive. Details \nappear in the CALIBRATION section of this manual.\nMODEL 05103\nWIND MONITOR\nWIND SPEED SPECIFICATION SUMMARY\nRange 0 to 100 m/s (224 mph)\nSensor 18 cm diameter 4-blade helicoid  \npropeller molded of polypropylene\nPitch 29.4 cm air passage per revolution\nDistance Constant 2.7 m (8.9 ft.) for 63% recovery\nThreshold Sensitivity 1.0 m/s (2.2 mph)\nTransducer Centrally mounted stationary coil, 2K Ohm \nnominal DC resistance\nTransducer Output AC sine wave signal induced by rotating \nmagnet on propeller shaft. 80 mV p-p at \n100 rpm. 8.0 V p-p at 10,000 rpm.\nOutput Frequency 3 cycles per propeller revolution  \n(0.098 m/s per Hz)\nWIND DIRECTION (AZIMUTH) SPECIFICATION SUMMARY\nRange 360\u00b0 mechanical, 355\u00b0 electrical (5\u00b0 open)\nSensor  Balanced vane, 38 cm (15 in) turning radius.\nDamping Ratio 0.3\nDelay Distance 1.3 m (4.3 ft) for 50% recovery\nThreshold Sensitivity 1.1 m/s (2.5 mph) at 10\u00b0 displacement\nDamped Natural\n   Wavelength 7.4 m (24.3 ft)\nUndamped Natural\n   Wavelength 7.2 m (23.6 ft)\nTransducer Precision conductive plastic potentiometer, \n10K ohm resistance (\u00b120%), 0.25% \nlinearity, life expectancy 50 million \nrevolutions, rated 1 watt at 40\u00b0 C, 0 watts \nat 125\u00b0 C\nTransducer Excitation\n  Requirement Regulated DC voltage, 15 VDC max\nTransducer Output Analog DC voltage proportional to azimuth \nangle with regulated excitation voltage \napplied across potentiometer.\nGENERAL\nOperating Temperature: -50 to 50\u00b0C (-58 to 122\u00b0F)\n\n\nPage 3:\nPage 2\n05103-90(N)\nINSTALLATION\nProper placement of the instrument is very important. Eddies from \ntrees, buildings, or other structures can greatly influence wind \nspeed and wind direction observations. To get meaningful data \nfor most applications locate the instrument well above or upwind \nfrom obstructions. As a general rule, the air flow around a structure \nis disturbed to twice the height of the structure upwind, six times \nthe height downwind, and up to twice the height of the structure \nabove ground. For some applications it may not be practical or \nnecessary to meet these requirements.\nFAILURE TO PROPERLY GROUND THE WIND MONITOR  \nMAY RESULT IN ERRONEOUS SIGNALS  \nOR TRANSDUCER DAMAGE.\nGrounding the Wind Monitor is vitally important. Without proper \ngrounding, static electrical charge can build up during certain \natmospheric conditions and discharge through the transducers. \nThis discharge can cause erroneous signals or transducer failure. \nTo direct the discharge away from the transducers, the mounting \npost assembly is made with a special antistatic plastic. It is very \nimportant that the mounting post be connected to a good earth \nground. There are two ways this may be accomplished. First, \nthe Wind Monitor may be mounted on a metal pipe which is \nconnected to earth ground. The mounting pipe should not be \npainted where the Wind Monitor is mounted. Towers or masts \nset in concrete should be connected to one or more grounding \nrods. If it is difficult to ground the mounting post in this manner, \nthe following method should be used. Inside the junction box \nthe terminal labeled EARTH GND is internally connected to the \nantistatic mounting post. This terminal should be connected to \nan earth ground (Refer to wiring diagram).\nInitial installation is most easily done with two people; one to adjust \nthe instrument position and the other to observe the indicating \ndevice. After initial installation, the instrument can be removed \nand returned to its mounting without realigning the vane since \nthe orientation ring preserves the wind direction reference. Install \nthe Wind Monitor following these steps:\n1. MOUNT WIND MONITOR\n a) Place orientation ring on mounting post. Do Not tighten \nband clamp yet.\n b) Place Wind Monitor on mounting post. Do Not tighten \nband clamp yet. \n  \n2. CONNECT SENSOR CABLE\n a) Refer to wiring diagram located at back of manual.\n \n3. ALIGN VANE\n a) Connect instrument to an indicator.\n b) Choose a known wind direction reference point on the \nhorizon.\n c) Sighting down instrument centerline, point nose cone at  \nreference point on horizon.\n d) While holding vane in position, slowly turn base until \nindicator shows proper value.\n e) Tighten mounting post band clamp.\n f) Engage orientation ring indexing pin in notch at \ninstrument base.\n g) Tighten orientation ring band clamp.\nCALIBRATION\nThe Wind Monitor is fully calibrated before shipment and should \nrequire no adjustments. Recalibration may be necessary after \nsome maintenance operations. Periodic calibration checks are \ndesirable and may be necessary where the instrument is used in \nprograms which require auditing of sensor performance.\nAccurate wind direction calibration requires a Model 18112 Vane \nAngle Bench Stand. Begin by connecting the instrument to a \nsignal conditioning circuit which has some method of indicating \nwind direction value. This may be a display which shows wind \ndirection values in angular degrees or simply a voltmeter \nmonitoring the output. Orient the base so the junction box faces \ndue south. Visually align the vane with the crossmarkings and \nobserve the indicator output. If the vane position and indicator \ndo not agree within 5\u00b0, adjust the potentiometer coupling inside \nthe main housing. Details for making this adjustment appear \nin the MAINTENANCE, POTENTIOMETER REPLACEMENT, \noutline, step 7. \nIt is important to note that, while the sensor mechanically rotates \nthrough 360\u00b0, the full scale wind direction signal from the signal \nconditioning occurs at 355\u00b0. The signal conditioning electronics \nmust be adjusted accordingly. For example, in a circuit where 0 \nto 1.000 VDC represents 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0, the output must be adjusted \nfor 0.986 VDC when the instrument is at 355\u00b0. (355\u00b0/360\u00b0 X 1.000 \nvolts = 0.986 volts)\nWind speed calibration is determined by propeller pitch and the \noutput characteristics of the transducer. Calibration formulas \nshowing wind speed vs. propeller rpm and output frequency are \nincluded below. Standard accuracy is \u00b1 0.3 m/s (0.6mph). For \ngreater accuracy, the sensor must be individually calibrated in \ncomparison with a wind speed standard. Contact the factory or \nyour supplier to schedule a NIST (National Institute of Standards \n& Technology) traceable wind tunnel calibration in our facility.\n \nTo calibrate wind system electronics using a signal from the \ninstrument, temporarily remove the propeller and connect an \nAnemometer Drive (18802 or equivalent)  to the propeller shaft. \nApply the appropriate calibration formula to the calibrating motor \nrpm and adjust the electronics for the proper value. For example, \nwith the propeller shaft turning at 3600 rpm, adjust an indicator to \ndisplay 17.6 meters per second [3600 rpm  X 0.00490 (m/s)/rpm \n=17.6 m/s]\nDetails on checking bearing torque, which affects wind speed and \ndirection threshold, appear in the following section.\nCALIBRATION FORMULAS\nModel 05103 Wind Monitor w / 08234 Propeller\nWIND SPEED  vs  PROPELLER RPM\nm/s = 0.00490 x rpm\nknots = 0.00952 x rpm\nmph = 0.01096 x rpm\nkm/h = 0.01764 x rpm\nWIND SPEED  vs  OUTPUT FREQUENCY\nm/s = 0.0980 x Hz\nknots = 0.1904 x Hz\nmph = 0.2192 x Hz\nkm/h = 0.3528 x Hz\n\nPage 4:\nPage 3\n05103-90(N)\nMAINTENANCE\nGiven proper care, the Wind Monitor should provide years of \nservice. The only components likely to need replacement due to \nnormal wear are the precision ball bearings and the wind direction \npotentiometer. Only a qualified instrument technician should \nperform the replacement. If service facilities are not available, \nreturn the instrument to the company. Refer to the drawings to \nbecome familiar with part names and locations. The asterisk * \nwhich appears in the following outlines is a reminder that maximum \ntorque on all set screws is 80 oz-in.\nPOTENTIOMETER REPLACEMENT\nThe potentiometer has a life expectancy of fifty million revolutions. \nAs it becomes worn, the element may begin to produce noisy \nsignals or become nonlinear.

For extended operation, an \nAC wall adapter is included.\nModel 18811 Anemometer Drive is identical to Model 18802 except the drive motor incorporates a \ngear reducer for operation in the range of 20 to 990 RPM in 10 RPM increments. The lower range \nis recommended for cup anemometer calibration.\nModel 18112 Vane Angle Bench Stand is used for benchtop wind direction calibration of the Wind Monitor \nfamily of sensors. The mounting post engages the direction orientation notch on the Wind Monitor. An easy to \nread pointer indicates 0 to 360 degrees with 1/2 degree resolution.\nModel 18212 Vane Angle Fixture - Tower Mount similar to the Model 18112, the tower mount feature allows use \non the tower as well as the bench top. The fixture is temporarily placed on the tower between the Wind Monitor \nand its tower mounting. Index keys and notches are engaged to preserve direction reference.\nModel 18310 Propeller Torque Disc checks anemometer bearing torque with 0.1 gm/cm resolu-\ntion. The disc temporarily replaces the propeller for torque measurement or simple yet accurate pass/fail \nchecks. Charts included with the unit relate torque to propeller threshold with limits for acceptable \nbearing performance.\nModel 18312 Cup-Wheel Torque Disc checks cup anemometer bearing torque.\nModel 18331 Vane Torque Gauge checks vane bearing torque of the Wind Monitor family sensors. Slip the \nfixture over the main housing and make simple yet accurate vane torque measurements. Charts relating vane \ntorque to vane threshold provide limits for acceptable bearing performance.\nModel 18301 Vane Alignment Rod helps align the vane of a wind sensor to a known direction reference during \ninstallation. The base of the device has an index key that engages the direction orientation notch in the sensor \nallowing the sensor to be removed without losing wind direction reference.\nSpecifications subject to change without notice. \nYOUNG\n Specifications\n Ordering Information                                                                  MODEL\nR.M.

The main housing, \nnose cone, propeller, and other internal parts are injection molded \nU.V. stabilized plastic. Both the propeller and vertical shafts use \nstainless steel precision grade ball bearings.  Bearings have light \ncontacting teflon seals and are filled with a wide temperature range \ngrease to help exclude contamination and moisture.\nPropeller rotation produces an AC sine wave signal with frequency \nproportional to wind speed. This AC signal is induced in a \nstationary coil by a six pole magnet mounted on the propeller \nshaft. Three complete sine wave cycles are produced for each \npropeller revolution.\nVane position is transmitted by a 10K ohm precision conductive \nplastic potentiometer which requires a regulated excitation \nvoltage. With a constant voltage applied to the potentiometer, \nthe output signal is an analog voltage directly proportional to \nwind  direction angle.\nThe instrument mounts on standard one inch pipe, outside diameter \n34 mm (1.34\"). An orientation ring is provided so the instrument \ncan be removed for maintenance and reinstalled without loss of \nwind direction reference. Both the mounting post assembly and \nthe orientation ring are secured to the mounting pipe by stainless \nsteel band clamps. Electrical connections are made in a junction \nbox at the base. A variety of devices are available for signal \nconditioning, display, and recording of wind speed and direction.  \nINITIAL CHECKOUT\nWhen the Wind Monitor is unpacked it should be checked carefully \nfor any signs of shipping damage.  \nRemove the plastic nut on the propeller shaft. Install the propeller \non the shaft so the serial number on the propeller faces forward \n(into the wind). Engage the propeller into the molded ribs on the \npropeller shaft hub. The instrument is aligned, balanced and fully \ncalibrated before shipment, however, it should be checked both \nmechanically and electrically before installation. The vane and \npropeller should easily rotate 360\u00b0 without friction. Check vane \nbalance by holding the instrument base so the vane surface is \nhorizontal. It should have near neutral torque without any particular \ntendency to rotate. A slight imbalance will not degrade performance.\nThe potentiometer requires a stable DC excitation voltage.  Do \nnot exceed 15 volts. When the potentiometer wiper is in the 5\u00b0 \ndeadband region, the output signal is \"floating\" and may show \nvarying or unpredictable values. To prevent false readings,  signal \nconditioning electronics should clamp the signal to excitation \nor reference level when this occurs. NOTE: Young signal \nconditioning devices clamp the signal to excitation level. Avoid \na short circuit between the wind direction signal line and either the \nexcitation or reference lines. Although there is a 1K ohm current \nlimiting resistor in series with the wiper for protection, damage \nto the potentiometer may occur if a short circuit condition exists.\nBefore installation, connect the instrument to an indicator as shown \nin the wiring diagram and check for proper wind speed and wind \ndirection values. To check wind speed, temporarily remove the \npropeller and connect the shaft to an Anemometer Drive. Details \nappear in the CALIBRATION section of this manual.\nMODEL 05103\nWIND MONITOR\nWIND SPEED SPECIFICATION SUMMARY\nRange 0 to 100 m/s (224 mph)\nSensor 18 cm diameter 4-blade helicoid  \npropeller molded of polypropylene\nPitch 29.4 cm air passage per revolution\nDistance Constant 2.7 m (8.9 ft.) for 63% recovery\nThreshold Sensitivity 1.0 m/s (2.2 mph)\nTransducer Centrally mounted stationary coil, 2K Ohm \nnominal DC resistance\nTransducer Output AC sine wave signal induced by rotating \nmagnet on propeller shaft. 80 mV p-p at \n100 rpm. 8.0 V p-p at 10,000 rpm.\nOutput Frequency 3 cycles per propeller revolution  \n(0.098 m/s per Hz)\nWIND DIRECTION (AZIMUTH) SPECIFICATION SUMMARY\nRange 360\u00b0 mechanical, 355\u00b0 electrical (5\u00b0 open)\nSensor  Balanced vane, 38 cm (15 in) turning radius.\nDamping Ratio 0.3\nDelay Distance 1.3 m (4.3 ft) for 50% recovery\nThreshold Sensitivity 1.1 m/s (2.5 mph) at 10\u00b0 displacement\nDamped Natural\n   Wavelength 7.4 m (24.3 ft)\nUndamped Natural\n   Wavelength 7.2 m (23.6 ft)\nTransducer Precision conductive plastic potentiometer, \n10K ohm resistance (\u00b120%), 0.25% \nlinearity, life expectancy 50 million \nrevolutions, rated 1 watt at 40\u00b0 C, 0 watts \nat 125\u00b0 C\nTransducer Excitation\n  Requirement Regulated DC voltage, 15 VDC max\nTransducer Output Analog DC voltage proportional to azimuth \nangle with regulated excitation voltage \napplied across potentiometer.\nGENERAL\nOperating Temperature: -50 to 50\u00b0C (-58 to 122\u00b0F)\n\n\nPage 3:\nPage 2\n05103-90(N)\nINSTALLATION\nProper placement of the instrument is very important. Eddies from \ntrees, buildings, or other structures can greatly influence wind \nspeed and wind direction observations. To get meaningful data \nfor most applications locate the instrument well above or upwind \nfrom obstructions. As a general rule, the air flow around a structure \nis disturbed to twice the height of the structure upwind, six times \nthe height downwind, and up to twice the height of the structure \nabove ground. For some applications it may not be practical or \nnecessary to meet these requirements.\nFAILURE TO PROPERLY GROUND THE WIND MONITOR  \nMAY RESULT IN ERRONEOUS SIGNALS  \nOR TRANSDUCER DAMAGE.\nGrounding the Wind Monitor is vitally important. Without proper \ngrounding, static electrical charge can build up during certain \natmospheric conditions and discharge through the transducers. \nThis discharge can cause erroneous signals or transducer failure. \nTo direct the discharge away from the transducers, the mounting \npost assembly is made with a special antistatic plastic. It is very \nimportant that the mounting post be connected to a good earth \nground. There are two ways this may be accomplished. First, \nthe Wind Monitor may be mounted on a metal pipe which is \nconnected to earth ground. The mounting pipe should not be \npainted where the Wind Monitor is mounted. Towers or masts \nset in concrete should be connected to one or more grounding \nrods. If it is difficult to ground the mounting post in this manner, \nthe following method should be used. Inside the junction box \nthe terminal labeled EARTH GND is internally connected to the \nantistatic mounting post. This terminal should be connected to \nan earth ground (Refer to wiring diagram).\nInitial installation is most easily done with two people; one to adjust \nthe instrument position and the other to observe the indicating \ndevice. After initial installation, the instrument can be removed \nand returned to its mounting without realigning the vane since \nthe orientation ring preserves the wind direction reference. Install \nthe Wind Monitor following these steps:\n1. MOUNT WIND MONITOR\n a) Place orientation ring on mounting post. Do Not tighten \nband clamp yet.\n b) Place Wind Monitor on mounting post. Do Not tighten \nband clamp yet. \n  \n2. CONNECT SENSOR CABLE\n a) Refer to wiring diagram located at back of manual.\n \n3. ALIGN VANE\n a) Connect instrument to an indicator.\n b) Choose a known wind direction reference point on the \nhorizon.\n c) Sighting down instrument centerline, point nose cone at  \nreference point on horizon.\n d) While holding vane in position, slowly turn base until \nindicator shows proper value.\n e) Tighten mounting post band clamp.\n f) Engage orientation ring indexing pin in notch at \ninstrument base.\n g) Tighten orientation ring band clamp.\nCALIBRATION\nThe Wind Monitor is fully calibrated before shipment and should \nrequire no adjustments. Recalibration may be necessary after \nsome maintenance operations. Periodic calibration checks are \ndesirable and may be necessary where the instrument is used in \nprograms which require auditing of sensor performance.\nAccurate wind direction calibration requires a Model 18112 Vane \nAngle Bench Stand. Begin by connecting the instrument to a \nsignal conditioning circuit which has some method of indicating \nwind direction value. This may be a display which shows wind \ndirection values in angular degrees or simply a voltmeter \nmonitoring the output. Orient the base so the junction box faces \ndue south. Visually align the vane with the crossmarkings and \nobserve the indicator output. If the vane position and indicator \ndo not agree within 5\u00b0, adjust the potentiometer coupling inside \nthe main housing. Details for making this adjustment appear \nin the MAINTENANCE, POTENTIOMETER REPLACEMENT, \noutline, step 7. \nIt is important to note that, while the sensor mechanically rotates \nthrough 360\u00b0, the full scale wind direction signal from the signal \nconditioning occurs at 355\u00b0. The signal conditioning electronics \nmust be adjusted accordingly. For example, in a circuit where 0 \nto 1.000 VDC represents 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0, the output must be adjusted \nfor 0.986 VDC when the instrument is at 355\u00b0. (355\u00b0/360\u00b0 X 1.000 \nvolts = 0.986 volts)\nWind speed calibration is determined by propeller pitch and the \noutput characteristics of the transducer. Calibration formulas \nshowing wind speed vs. propeller rpm and output frequency are \nincluded below. Standard accuracy is \u00b1 0.3 m/s (0.6mph). For \ngreater accuracy, the sensor must be individually calibrated in \ncomparison with a wind speed standard. Contact the factory or \nyour supplier to schedule a NIST (National Institute of Standards \n& Technology) traceable wind tunnel calibration in our facility.\n \nTo calibrate wind system electronics using a signal from the \ninstrument, temporarily remove the propeller and connect an \nAnemometer Drive (18802 or equivalent)  to the propeller shaft. \nApply the appropriate calibration formula to the calibrating motor \nrpm and adjust the electronics for the proper value. For example, \nwith the propeller shaft turning at 3600 rpm, adjust an indicator to \ndisplay 17.6 meters per second [3600 rpm  X 0.00490 (m/s)/rpm \n=17.6 m/s]\nDetails on checking bearing torque, which affects wind speed and \ndirection threshold, appear in the following section.\nCALIBRATION FORMULAS\nModel 05103 Wind Monitor w / 08234 Propeller\nWIND SPEED  vs  PROPELLER RPM\nm/s = 0.00490 x rpm\nknots = 0.00952 x rpm\nmph = 0.01096 x rpm\nkm/h = 0.01764 x rpm\nWIND SPEED  vs  OUTPUT FREQUENCY\nm/s = 0.0980 x Hz\nknots = 0.1904 x Hz\nmph = 0.2192 x Hz\nkm/h = 0.3528 x Hz\n\nPage 4:\nPage 3\n05103-90(N)\nMAINTENANCE\nGiven proper care, the Wind Monitor should provide years of \nservice. The only components likely to need replacement due to \nnormal wear are the precision ball bearings and the wind direction \npotentiometer. Only a qualified instrument technician should \nperform the replacement. If service facilities are not available, \nreturn the instrument to the company.
