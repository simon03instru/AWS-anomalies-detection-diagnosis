Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count\ninstruction.\n2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the\nPulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.\nDisconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check\nof the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket\nbetween the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket\nis tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.\nSymptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12\n1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and\nTable 7-3 [p. 10]).\n\nMaintenance\nDuring each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,\ndebris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.\nVerify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket\ntip.\nDismantling for cleaning\nRegularly check the following items for cleanliness:\nl Catch filter\nl Siphon\nl Interior of bucket\nl Top surface of adjusting screws\nl Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning\nl Insect screens\nTo access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:\n1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and\nlifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).\n\n2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base\nSeparate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the\nsiphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).\nCAUTION:\nDo not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.\n\nDisassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):\na. Unscrew nut\nb. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body\nc. Remove stem from siphon body\nd. Unscrew cap\ne. Clean all items\n\nReassembling the rain bucket\n1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).\nPush stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).\nReplace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).\nCAUTION:\nDo not over tighten.\nPush filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).\nCAUTION:\nDo not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.\n5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure\nthe housing onto the base.\n\nCalibration check\nThe sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the\nadjustment screws have loosened.\nNevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:\n1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting\nupward on the housing.\n2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.\n3.

Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and\nlifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).\n\n2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base\nSeparate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the\nsiphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).\nCAUTION:\nDo not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.\n\nDisassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):\na. Unscrew nut\nb. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body\nc. Remove stem from siphon body\nd. Unscrew cap\ne. Clean all items\n\nReassembling the rain bucket\n1. 2.

Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure\nthe housing onto the base.\n\nCalibration check\nThe sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the\nadjustment screws have loosened.\nNevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:\n1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting\nupward on the housing.\n2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.\n3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated\ncylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection\nfunnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).\n4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39\ntimes.\n5. If the rain gage fails to record the correct number of tips, return the unit to Campbell\nScientific for recalibration (see Assistance at the back of this manual).\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "18fd44f3-6b3a-5c7d-ab5d-c2e3f76a2897", "label": "tipping bucket taingauge model tb4", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "18fd44f3-6b3a-5c7d-ab5d-c2e3f76a2897", "description": "A model of a rainfall gauge manufactured by Hyquest Solutions.", "name": "tipping bucket taingauge model tb4", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "032aca3f-4f84-5e32-b8a9-a343e673eca0", "label": "field calibration device model tb320", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "032aca3f-4f84-5e32-b8a9-a343e673eca0", "description": "A device for routine field check calibrations supplied by Hyquest Solutions.", "name": "field calibration device model tb320", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.27354153873717624}}], "edges": [{"source": "b8cf947e-bad2-5ebd-b05a-3f74ace95e55", "target": "18fd44f3-6b3a-5c7d-ab5d-c2e3f76a2897", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "18fd44f3-6b3a-5c7d-ab5d-c2e3f76a2897", "target": "b8cf947e-bad2-5ebd-b05a-3f74ace95e55", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "b8cf947e-bad2-5ebd-b05a-3f74ace95e55", "target": "032aca3f-4f84-5e32-b8a9-a343e673eca0", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["The HyQuest TB4 rainfall sensor has a sensitivity range of 0-100 mm per hour with an accuracy of better than +/-2%, and it can measure rainfall intensities up to 700 mm per hour."], "chunks": null, "graph": null, "metadata": null, "score": null, "raw_data": {"search_result": ["The HyQuest TB4 rainfall sensor has a sensitivity range of 0-100 mm per hour with an accuracy of better than +/-2%, and it can measure rainfall intensities up to 700 mm per hour."], "dataset_id": "33aab9e8-73f0-588b-a15f-d24952b8e9bd", "dataset_name": "sensor_knowledge", "graphs": {"sensor_knowledge": {"nodes": [{"id": "03ee91d0-e64b-53e9-b541-43ba37bfeec0", "label": "", "type": "DocumentChunk", "attributes": {"id": "03ee91d0-e64b-53e9-b541-43ba37bfeec0", "description": null, "name": "", "type": "DocumentChunk", "text": "Page 1:\nGeneral Description\nHyQuest Solutions\u2019 TB6 is a non-syphoning \nhigh-quality tipping bucket rain gauge for \nmeasuring rainfall and precipitation in urban \nand rural locations.

Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count\ninstruction.\n2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the\nPulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.\nDisconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check\nof the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket\nbetween the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket\nis tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.\nSymptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12\n1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and\nTable 7-3 [p. 10]).\n\nMaintenance\nDuring each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,\ndebris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.\nVerify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket\ntip.\nDismantling for cleaning\nRegularly check the following items for cleanliness:\nl Catch filter\nl Siphon\nl Interior of bucket\nl Top surface of adjusting screws\nl Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning\nl Insect screens\nTo access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:\n1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and\nlifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).\n\n2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base\nSeparate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the\nsiphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).\nCAUTION:\nDo not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.\n\nDisassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):\na. Unscrew nut\nb. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body\nc. Remove stem from siphon body\nd. Unscrew cap\ne. Clean all items\n\nReassembling the rain bucket\n1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).\nPush stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).\nReplace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).\nCAUTION:\nDo not over tighten.\nPush filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).\nCAUTION:\nDo not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.\n5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure\nthe housing onto the base.\n\nCalibration check\nThe sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the\nadjustment screws have loosened.\nNevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:\n1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting\nupward on the housing.\n2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.\n3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated\ncylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection\nfunnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).\n4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39\ntimes.\n5. If the rain gage fails to record the correct number of tips, return the unit to Campbell\nScientific for recalibration (see Assistance at the back of this manual).\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "18fd44f3-6b3a-5c7d-ab5d-c2e3f76a2897", "label": "tipping bucket taingauge model tb4", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "18fd44f3-6b3a-5c7d-ab5d-c2e3f76a2897", "description": "A model of a rainfall gauge manufactured by Hyquest Solutions.", "name": "tipping bucket taingauge model tb4", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "032aca3f-4f84-5e32-b8a9-a343e673eca0", "label": "field calibration device model tb320", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "032aca3f-4f84-5e32-b8a9-a343e673eca0", "description": "A device for routine field check calibrations supplied by Hyquest Solutions.", "name": "field calibration device model tb320", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.19618201960621515}}], "edges": [{"source": "b8cf947e-bad2-5ebd-b05a-3f74ace95e55", "target": "18fd44f3-6b3a-5c7d-ab5d-c2e3f76a2897", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "18fd44f3-6b3a-5c7d-ab5d-c2e3f76a2897", "target": "b8cf947e-bad2-5ebd-b05a-3f74ace95e55", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "b8cf947e-bad2-5ebd-b05a-3f74ace95e55", "target": "032aca3f-4f84-5e32-b8a9-a343e673eca0", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["### Troubleshooting, Maintenance, and Calibration Information for HyQuest TB4 Rainfall Sensor:\n- **Common Causes for Sudden Rainfall Spikes:**\n  1.
