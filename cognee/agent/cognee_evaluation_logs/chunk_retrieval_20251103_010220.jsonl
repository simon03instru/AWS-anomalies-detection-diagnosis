The TB6 is the device of \nchoice for accurately measuring low rainfall \nevents (0-50 mm/hr with better than +/-1 % \naccuracy), because the water passes through \nthe nozzle and enters the bucket directly al-\nlowing small rainfall events to be measured. \nThe TB6\u2019s tried and proven design ensures \nlong-term, accurate and repeatable results. \nIt is manufactured from high quality, dura-\nble materials ensuring long term stability in \nthe harshest of environments.

The TB6 is the device of \nchoice for accurately measuring low rainfall \nevents (0-50 mm/hr with better than +/-1 % \naccuracy), because the water passes through \nthe nozzle and enters the bucket directly al-\nlowing small rainfall events to be measured. \nThe TB6\u2019s tried and proven design ensures \nlong-term, accurate and repeatable results. \nIt is manufactured from high quality, dura-\nble materials ensuring long term stability in \nthe harshest of environments. It consists of \na robust powder-coated aluminium enclo-\nsure, a UV-resistant ASA polymer base, and \nstainless steel fasteners and \ufb01  nger \ufb01  lter. \nEasy maintenance\nRemoval of the outer enclosure and access \nto the tipping bucket mechanism and \ufb01  nger \n\ufb01  lter assembly is made easy with quick \nrelease fasteners. The \ufb01  nger \ufb01  lter can be \nremoved easily during a \ufb01  eld service.

Kemungkinan kondisi baterai drop; \n2. Kondisi Wiring (pada Solar Panel terjadi Solar Panel terjadi masalah).\n\nRekomendasi:\nSegera lakukan pengecekan pada power supply terutama pada baterai dan panel surya\n\n\nCONTOH KASUS 2\n--------------\nContoh Kasus: Site off\n\nDiagnosis: baterai drop\n\nTroubleshooting:\ncek nilai tegangan baterai raw data, hubungi penjaga untuk mengakses reulator untuk melihat historical tegangan\n\nRekomendasi:\npada regulator gunakan output dev algoritm (lengna range 9-11 untuk menjaga kesehatan baterai\n\n\nCONTOH KASUS 3\n--------------\nContoh Kasus: Alat mati total dan tidak beroperasi\n\nDiagnosis: perangkat catu daya bermasalah\n\nTroubleshooting:\n1. Cek tegangan baterai, apakah baterai mengalami drop tegangan dan tidak dapat mengisi ulang; \n2. Periksa seluruh jalur pengkabelan daya (solar panel, baterai, regulator) apakah ada yang terputus; \n3. Periksa regulator apakah masih dalam keadaan baik dan dapat mengalirkan daya dari solar panel ke baterai untuk pengisian daya\n\nRekomendasi:\nSegera lakukan pengantian pada perangkat yang rusak agar alat dapat beroperasi kembali secara normal.\n\n\nCONTOH KASUS 4\n--------------\nContoh Kasus: Data tidak terkirim ke server\n\nDiagnosis: Kesalahan terjadi pada modem\n\nTroubleshooting:\n1.

Memory Leak : Ada bug dalam pemrograman sehingga memori (RAM) logger penuh.\n\nTroubleshooting:\n1. Lakukan Hard Reset / Power Cycle pada data logger (matikan paksa, tunggu 30 detik, nyalakan lagi) \n2. Periksa log file internal data logger (jika adat)untuk mencari pesan Error terakhir sebelum hang. \n3. Periksa versi firmware.
