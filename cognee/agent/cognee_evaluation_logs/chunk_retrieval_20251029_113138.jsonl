Clean any accumulated\ndust or debris off the dome and pyranometer body using a soft cloth dampened\nwith water or alcohol. Check that there is no condensation within the dome.\nCheck the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a\nfault. When doing this you should be aware of several expected phenomena\nthat can cause strange measurements. In particular on clear, windless nights the\nouter dome temperature of horizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as\nthe dew point temperature of the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with\nthe cold sky. (The effective sky temperature can be 30 \u00b0C lower than the\nground temperature, which results in an infrared emission of \u2013150 W/m2). If\nthis happens, dew, glazed frost or hoar frost can be precipitated on the top of\nthe outer dome and can stay there for several hours in the morning. An ice cap\non the dome is a strong diffuser and can increase the pyranometer signal by up\nto 50% in the first hours after sunrise.\nThe calibration of the CMP3 may drift with time and exposure to radiation.\nCampbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The sensor\nshould be returned to Campbell Scientific, the manufacturer, or a calibration\nlab with facilities to calibrate radiation sensors\n\nTroubleshooting\nSymptom: \u20139999 or radiation values around 0\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the terminal that is specified by the\nmeasurement instruction.\n2. Verify that the range is correct for the data logger type.\n3. Measure the impedance across the red and blue sensor wires. This should\nbe around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1 ohm/m). If the\nresistance is very low there may be a short circuit (check the wiring).\nResistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water ingress\ninto the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite, there is\na broken connection (check the wiring).\n4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.\nWith the sensor located 20 cm (8 inches) below a 60 W incandescent light\nbulb, the voltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a\nproblem with the sensor.\nSymptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low\n1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the\ndata logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual\ncalibration factor.\n2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.\nSymptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations\n1. 2. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation\n(radar, radio).\nCheck the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.\n3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.\n\n\n\nCMP6, CMP10, CMP11, CMP21 Kipp and Zonen Maintenance\n\nMaintenance\nEvery week, physically inspect the pyranometer to ensure that:\n\u2022 Dome is free of dirt, condensation, and ice. Remove accumulated dust,\ncondensation, or ice from the dome and pyranometer body by using a soft\ncloth dampened with water or alcohol (FIGURE 8-1).\n\u2022 The drying cartridge in the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 have orange and\nopaque desiccant granules (Section 8.1.1, Changing the Desiccant (p. 16)).\n\u2022 Mounting is secure.\n\u2022 Pyranometer is level or is at the correct angle.\n\u2022 Cables are in good condition.\n\nChanging the Desiccant\nThe CMP10 has an internal drying cartridge that will last for at least ten years\nif the housing is not opened. This significantly minimizes maintenance.\nThe drying cartridge of the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 uses desiccant that\nneeds to be periodically replaced. The silica gel desiccant granules in the\ndrying cartridge should be orange and opaque. Replace the desiccant granules\nwhen they become translucent (normally after several months). Refill packs of\ndesiccant are shipped with the pyranometer and can be purchased from\nCampbell Scientific. The drying cartridge uses the content of one refill pack.\nFIGURE 8-2 shows the replacement process.\nWhen changing the desiccant, ensure that:\n\u2022 Surfaces touching the rubber O-ring are clean. Dirt, in combination with\nwater, can cause corrosion, harming it.\n\u2022 Rubber O-ring is coated with silicon grease or petroleum jelly. The grease\ncoating improves the O-ring seal.\n\u2022 Drying cartridge is tightly threaded into the pyranometer body.\n\nCheck Sensor Output\nCheck the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a\nfault. However, several expected phenomena can cause strange measurements.\nIn particular, on clear, windless nights the outer dome temperature of\nhorizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as the dew point temperature\nof the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with the cold sky. (The effective\nsky temperature can be 30 \u00b0C lower than the ground temperature, which results\nin an infrared emission of \u2013150 W\u2022m\u20132). If this happens, dew, glazed frost or\nhoar frost can form on the top of the outer dome and can stay there for several\nhours in the morning. An ice cap on the dome is a strong diffuser and can\nincrease the pyranometer signal by up to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.\n\nRecalibration\nThe calibration of the pyranometer may drift with time and exposure to\nradiation. Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The\nsensor should be returned to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. Refer to the\nAssistance page for information on returning the pyranometer to Campbell\nScientific for recalibration.\n\nTroubleshooting\nSymptom: NAN, \u20139999, or radiation values around 0\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the differential terminal specified by the\nmeasurement instruction.\n2. Verify that the range code is correct for the data logger type.\n3. Measure the impedance across the white and black sensor wires. This\nshould be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1\nohm\u2022m\u20131). If the resistance is low, there may be a short circuit (check the\nwiring). Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water\ningress into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite,\nthere is a broken connection (check the wiring).\n4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.\nWith the sensor located 8 inches below a 60 W incandescent light bulb the\nvoltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a problem\nwith the sensor.\nSymptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low\n1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the\ndata logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual\ncalibration factor.\n2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.\nSymptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations\n1. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation,\nsuch as radar or radio interference.\n2. Check the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.\n3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "6e10c1bc-dfde-5a5c-87f5-98c8b985c438", "label": "cmp3 kipp and zonen pyranometer", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "6e10c1bc-dfde-5a5c-87f5-98c8b985c438", "description": "A pyranometer used to measure solar radiation.", "name": "cmp3 kipp and zonen pyranometer", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.06616933196877067}}, {"id": "b5177cac-fd01-5785-a2d5-0a3dd7fe7464", "label": "cmp11 kipp and zonen pyranometer", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "b5177cac-fd01-5785-a2d5-0a3dd7fe7464", "description": "A pyranometer used to measure solar radiation.", "name": "cmp11 kipp and zonen pyranometer", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.08775801375108756}}], "edges": [{"source": "4d319e84-be68-58b5-ab90-7b1a30d7bc41", "target": "6e10c1bc-dfde-5a5c-87f5-98c8b985c438", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "6e10c1bc-dfde-5a5c-87f5-98c8b985c438", "target": "4d319e84-be68-58b5-ab90-7b1a30d7bc41", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "4d319e84-be68-58b5-ab90-7b1a30d7bc41", "target": "b5177cac-fd01-5785-a2d5-0a3dd7fe7464", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["For troubleshooting calibration errors and sensor issues with the Vaisala HMP155 and Kipp & Zonen CMP3:\n\n1. **HMP155 Calibration Error (Vaisala HUMICAP\u00e2 180R sensor):** Ensure the probe is properly calibrated using a USB connection, push buttons, or through the MI70 indicator.

A wet probe\nmay not give an accurate measurement\nin the ambient air.\nThis is an environment to which Vaisala\nhas designed this patented, warmed\nprobe for reliable measurements. As\nthe sensor head is warmed continuously,\nthe humidity level inside it stays below\nthe ambient level. Thus, it also reduces\nthe risk of condensation forming on\nthe probe.\nFast measurements\nWith its fast response time,\nthe additional temperature probe for\nHMP155 is ideal for measuring in\nenvironments with changing\ntemperatures. The membrane filter\nspeeds up the relative humidity\nmeasurement.\nLong lifetime\nProtecting the sensor from precipitation,\nand scattered and direct solar radiation\nincreases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala\nrecommends installing HMP155 in one of\nthe following radiation shields: DTR503,\nDTR13, or Stevenson screen. For\nthe additional temperature probe,\nan installation kit is available for Vaisala\nDTR502 Radiation Shield.\nCalibration\nThe probe can be calibrated using\na computer with a USB cable, with\nthe push buttons, or with the MI70\nindicator.\nVaisala HUMICAP\u00e2 Humidity and Temperature Probe\nHMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature\nmeasurement.

A wet probe\nmay not give an accurate measurement\nin the ambient air.\nThis is an environment to which Vaisala\nhas designed this patented, warmed\nprobe for reliable measurements. As\nthe sensor head is warmed continuously,\nthe humidity level inside it stays below\nthe ambient level. Thus, it also reduces\nthe risk of condensation forming on\nthe probe.\nFast measurements\nWith its fast response time,\nthe additional temperature probe for\nHMP155 is ideal for measuring in\nenvironments with changing\ntemperatures. The membrane filter\nspeeds up the relative humidity\nmeasurement.\nLong lifetime\nProtecting the sensor from precipitation,\nand scattered and direct solar radiation\nincreases its lifetime.

Remove accumulated dust,\ncondensation, or ice from the dome and pyranometer body by using a soft\ncloth dampened with water or alcohol (FIGURE 8-1).\n\u2022 The drying cartridge in the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 have orange and\nopaque desiccant granules (Section 8.1.1, Changing the Desiccant (p. 16)).\n\u2022 Mounting is secure.\n\u2022 Pyranometer is level or is at the correct angle.\n\u2022 Cables are in good condition.\n\nChanging the Desiccant\nThe CMP10 has an internal drying cartridge that will last for at least ten years\nif the housing is not opened. This significantly minimizes maintenance.\nThe drying cartridge of the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 uses desiccant that\nneeds to be periodically replaced. The silica gel desiccant granules in the\ndrying cartridge should be orange and opaque. Replace the desiccant granules\nwhen they become translucent (normally after several months). Refill packs of\ndesiccant are shipped with the pyranometer and can be purchased from\nCampbell Scientific. The drying cartridge uses the content of one refill pack.\nFIGURE 8-2 shows the replacement process.\nWhen changing the desiccant, ensure that:\n\u2022 Surfaces touching the rubber O-ring are clean. Dirt, in combination with\nwater, can cause corrosion, harming it.\n\u2022 Rubber O-ring is coated with silicon grease or petroleum jelly. The grease\ncoating improves the O-ring seal.\n\u2022 Drying cartridge is tightly threaded into the pyranometer body.\n\nCheck Sensor Output\nCheck the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a\nfault. However, several expected phenomena can cause strange measurements.\nIn particular, on clear, windless nights the outer dome temperature of\nhorizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as the dew point temperature\nof the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with the cold sky. (The effective\nsky temperature can be 30 \u00b0C lower than the ground temperature, which results\nin an infrared emission of \u2013150 W\u2022m\u20132). If this happens, dew, glazed frost or\nhoar frost can form on the top of the outer dome and can stay there for several\nhours in the morning. An ice cap on the dome is a strong diffuser and can\nincrease the pyranometer signal by up to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.\n\nRecalibration\nThe calibration of the pyranometer may drift with time and exposure to\nradiation. Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The\nsensor should be returned to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. Refer to the\nAssistance page for information on returning the pyranometer to Campbell\nScientific for recalibration.\n\nTroubleshooting\nSymptom: NAN, \u20139999, or radiation values around 0\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the differential terminal specified by the\nmeasurement instruction.\n2. Verify that the range code is correct for the data logger type.\n3. Measure the impedance across the white and black sensor wires. This\nshould be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1\nohm\u2022m\u20131). If the resistance is low, there may be a short circuit (check the\nwiring). Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water\ningress into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite,\nthere is a broken connection (check the wiring).\n4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.\nWith the sensor located 8 inches below a 60 W incandescent light bulb the\nvoltage should be approximately 2.5 mV.

Remove accumulated dust,\ncondensation, or ice from the dome and pyranometer body by using a soft\ncloth dampened with water or alcohol (FIGURE 8-1).\n\u2022 The drying cartridge in the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 have orange and\nopaque desiccant granules (Section 8.1.1, Changing the Desiccant (p. 16)).\n\u2022 Mounting is secure.\n\u2022 Pyranometer is level or is at the correct angle.\n\u2022 Cables are in good condition.\n\nChanging the Desiccant\nThe CMP10 has an internal drying cartridge that will last for at least ten years\nif the housing is not opened. This significantly minimizes maintenance.\nThe drying cartridge of the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 uses desiccant that\nneeds to be periodically replaced. The silica gel desiccant granules in the\ndrying cartridge should be orange and opaque. Replace the desiccant granules\nwhen they become translucent (normally after several months). Refill packs of\ndesiccant are shipped with the pyranometer and can be purchased from\nCampbell Scientific. The drying cartridge uses the content of one refill pack.\nFIGURE 8-2 shows the replacement process.\nWhen changing the desiccant, ensure that:\n\u2022 Surfaces touching the rubber O-ring are clean. Dirt, in combination with\nwater, can cause corrosion, harming it.\n\u2022 Rubber O-ring is coated with silicon grease or petroleum jelly. The grease\ncoating improves the O-ring seal.\n\u2022 Drying cartridge is tightly threaded into the pyranometer body.\n\nCheck Sensor Output\nCheck the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a\nfault. However, several expected phenomena can cause strange measurements.\nIn particular, on clear, windless nights the outer dome temperature of\nhorizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as the dew point temperature\nof the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with the cold sky. (The effective\nsky temperature can be 30 \u00b0C lower than the ground temperature, which results\nin an infrared emission of \u2013150 W\u2022m\u20132). If this happens, dew, glazed frost or\nhoar frost can form on the top of the outer dome and can stay there for several\nhours in the morning. An ice cap on the dome is a strong diffuser and can\nincrease the pyranometer signal by up to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.\n\nRecalibration\nThe calibration of the pyranometer may drift with time and exposure to\nradiation. Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The\nsensor should be returned to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. Refer to the\nAssistance page for information on returning the pyranometer to Campbell\nScientific for recalibration.\n\nTroubleshooting\nSymptom: NAN, \u20139999, or radiation values around 0\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the differential terminal specified by the\nmeasurement instruction.\n2. Verify that the range code is correct for the data logger type.\n3.

When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.\nCAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.\n1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.\n2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.\nCAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.\n3. After removing the filter, check the O\u2011ring and change it if necessary.\n4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.\n5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.\n\nTroubleshooting\nSymptom: Relative Humidity is reported as \u20139999, NAN, \u201380 \u00b0C, or 0%\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the\nmeasurement instructions.\n2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is\ncorrect for the data logger type.\nVerify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the\nwire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.\nConnect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting\npurposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output\nvoltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively\n(temperature \u00b0C = mV * 0.14 \u2013 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).\nSymptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity\n1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger\nprogramming (p. 10)).\n\nMaintenance\nThe HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation\nshield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for\ncontaminates.\nWhen installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt\n(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an\naffinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the\nfilter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.\nThe filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed\nas well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.\nRecalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for\nthe procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.\n\nCleaning\nClean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.\nChanging the probe filter\n1. Remove the filter from the probe.\n2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.\n3. Install a new filter on the probe.\nNew filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.\n\n\nHygroVue Maintenance\n\nSyptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:\n\n1. Temperature is reported as\n\u20139999 or NAN, and relative\nhumidity is reported as 0 or\nan unchanging value.\n\nThis indicates a problem\nwith the SDI-12\ncommunications with the\nsensor.\n\nRecheck the sensor wiring.\nCheck the voltage to the sensor is 12V\nwith a digital voltage meter.\nVerify the sensor SDI-12 address\nmatches the address entered for the\nSDI12Recorder() instruction.\n\n2. Inaccurate temperature or\nrelative humidity is\nreported.\n\nInadequate delay after\npower-up (only applicable\nif using SW12)\nThe sensor element has\nbeen contaminated\nElectrical interference\n\nVerify the program is allowing a\npower-up time of at least 1.8 s.\nClean the sensor tip with distilled\nwater or replace it.\nEnsure the sensor is not installed too\nclose to a radio transmitter or cell\nphone.\n\n3. Temperature and relative\nhumidity read \u201399.999\n\nThis indicates a fault with\nthe sensor element itself or\ncommunication between\nthe sensor element and the\nelectronics in the sensor\nbody.\n\nCheck the sensor element is properly\nplugged in with the correct\norientation.\nCheck for water being present under\nthe sensor element connector and\nthere is no corrosion of the sensor\npins or the socket.\nSwap the element for another one.\n\n\nMaintenance\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter\ncap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If\ndirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is\nscrewed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers\u2014do not over tighten.\nCheck the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the\nshield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is\nneeded, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow\nthe shield to dry before remounting.\nCAUTION:\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect\nthe electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the\nsensor body\n\n\nCalibration\nThe life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own\nacceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner\nenvironments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the\nsensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell\nScientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively\nbrings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.\nIf you wish to check an old element\u2019s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it\ninto another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.\nNOTE:\nWe cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed\nevery yea\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "label": "pt100 temperature sensor", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "description": "Temperature sensor soldered to the HMP155 probe.", "name": "pt100 temperature sensor", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.23071981811987502}}, {"id": "a5cef0a0-f321-5298-94a0-9c4616d7be28", "label": "hmp155", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "a5cef0a0-f321-5298-94a0-9c4616d7be28", "description": "A probe used for measuring temperature and humidity.", "name": "hmp155", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.3989962006785744}}], "edges": [{"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "target": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "a5cef0a0-f321-5298-94a0-9c4616d7be28", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor has an operational temperature range of -80 to +60 \u00b0C (-112 to +140 \u00b0F).

When doing this you should be aware of several expected phenomena\nthat can cause strange measurements.

Remove accumulated dust,\ncondensation, or ice from the dome and pyranometer body by using a soft\ncloth dampened with water or alcohol (FIGURE 8-1).\n\u2022 The drying cartridge in the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 have orange and\nopaque desiccant granules (Section 8.1.1, Changing the Desiccant (p. 16)).\n\u2022 Mounting is secure.\n\u2022 Pyranometer is level or is at the correct angle.\n\u2022 Cables are in good condition.\n\nChanging the Desiccant\nThe CMP10 has an internal drying cartridge that will last for at least ten years\nif the housing is not opened. This significantly minimizes maintenance.\nThe drying cartridge of the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 uses desiccant that\nneeds to be periodically replaced. The silica gel desiccant granules in the\ndrying cartridge should be orange and opaque. Replace the desiccant granules\nwhen they become translucent (normally after several months). Refill packs of\ndesiccant are shipped with the pyranometer and can be purchased from\nCampbell Scientific. The drying cartridge uses the content of one refill pack.\nFIGURE 8-2 shows the replacement process.\nWhen changing the desiccant, ensure that:\n\u2022 Surfaces touching the rubber O-ring are clean. Dirt, in combination with\nwater, can cause corrosion, harming it.\n\u2022 Rubber O-ring is coated with silicon grease or petroleum jelly. The grease\ncoating improves the O-ring seal.\n\u2022 Drying cartridge is tightly threaded into the pyranometer body.\n\nCheck Sensor Output\nCheck the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a\nfault. However, several expected phenomena can cause strange measurements.\nIn particular, on clear, windless nights the outer dome temperature of\nhorizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as the dew point temperature\nof the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with the cold sky. (The effective\nsky temperature can be 30 \u00b0C lower than the ground temperature, which results\nin an infrared emission of \u2013150 W\u2022m\u20132). If this happens, dew, glazed frost or\nhoar frost can form on the top of the outer dome and can stay there for several\nhours in the morning. An ice cap on the dome is a strong diffuser and can\nincrease the pyranometer signal by up to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.\n\nRecalibration\nThe calibration of the pyranometer may drift with time and exposure to\nradiation. Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The\nsensor should be returned to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. Refer to the\nAssistance page for information on returning the pyranometer to Campbell\nScientific for recalibration.\n\nTroubleshooting\nSymptom: NAN, \u20139999, or radiation values around 0\n1. Check that the sensor is wired to the differential terminal specified by the\nmeasurement instruction.\n2. Verify that the range code is correct for the data logger type.\n3. Measure the impedance across the white and black sensor wires. This\nshould be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1\nohm\u2022m\u20131). If the resistance is low, there may be a short circuit (check the\nwiring). Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water\ningress into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite,\nthere is a broken connection (check the wiring).\n4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.\nWith the sensor located 8 inches below a 60 W incandescent light bulb the\nvoltage should be approximately 2.5 mV.

The channel the\nwire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.\nConnect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting\npurposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output\nvoltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively\n(temperature \u00b0C = mV * 0.14 \u2013 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).\nSymptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity\n1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger\nprogramming (p. 10)).\n\nMaintenance\nThe HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation\nshield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for\ncontaminates.\nWhen installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt\n(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an\naffinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the\nfilter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.\nThe filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed\nas well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.\nRecalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for\nthe procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.\n\nCleaning\nClean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.\nChanging the probe filter\n1. Remove the filter from the probe.\n2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.\n3. Install a new filter on the probe.\nNew filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.\n\n\nHygroVue Maintenance\n\nSyptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:\n\n1. Temperature is reported as\n\u20139999 or NAN, and relative\nhumidity is reported as 0 or\nan unchanging value.\n\nThis indicates a problem\nwith the SDI-12\ncommunications with the\nsensor.\n\nRecheck the sensor wiring.\nCheck the voltage to the sensor is 12V\nwith a digital voltage meter.\nVerify the sensor SDI-12 address\nmatches the address entered for the\nSDI12Recorder() instruction.\n\n2. Inaccurate temperature or\nrelative humidity is\nreported.\n\nInadequate delay after\npower-up (only applicable\nif using SW12)\nThe sensor element has\nbeen contaminated\nElectrical interference\n\nVerify the program is allowing a\npower-up time of at least 1.8 s.\nClean the sensor tip with distilled\nwater or replace it.\nEnsure the sensor is not installed too\nclose to a radio transmitter or cell\nphone.\n\n3. Temperature and relative\nhumidity read \u201399.999\n\nThis indicates a fault with\nthe sensor element itself or\ncommunication between\nthe sensor element and the\nelectronics in the sensor\nbody.\n\nCheck the sensor element is properly\nplugged in with the correct\norientation.\nCheck for water being present under\nthe sensor element connector and\nthere is no corrosion of the sensor\npins or the socket.\nSwap the element for another one.\n\n\nMaintenance\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter\ncap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If\ndirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is\nscrewed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers\u2014do not over tighten.\nCheck the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the\nshield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is\nneeded, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow\nthe shield to dry before remounting.\nCAUTION:\nThe HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect\nthe electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the\nsensor body\n\n\nCalibration\nThe life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own\nacceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner\nenvironments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the\nsensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell\nScientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively\nbrings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.\nIf you wish to check an old element\u2019s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it\ninto another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.\nNOTE:\nWe cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed\nevery yea\n\n", "vector_distance": 0.0}}, {"id": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "label": "pt100 temperature sensor", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "description": "Temperature sensor soldered to the HMP155 probe.", "name": "pt100 temperature sensor", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.3257796185052687}}, {"id": "a5cef0a0-f321-5298-94a0-9c4616d7be28", "label": "hmp155", "type": "Entity", "attributes": {"id": "a5cef0a0-f321-5298-94a0-9c4616d7be28", "description": "A probe used for measuring temperature and humidity.", "name": "hmp155", "type": "Entity", "text": null, "vector_distance": 0.37549998589539396}}], "edges": [{"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "49341889-e33d-53bb-8915-4f57f1670ed2", "target": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "462d4249-b15e-541c-bf94-c1e3b140182a", "target": "a5cef0a0-f321-5298-94a0-9c4616d7be28", "label": "contains"}]}}}}, {"chunk_index": 1, "result_type": "dict", "search_result": ["### Troubleshooting Guides for Vaisala HMP155 Temperature Sensor\n1. **Low Temperature Reading Issues**:\n   - **Check Sensor Condition**: Ensure the sensor is not damaged and is protected from environmental elements.\n   - **Calibration**: Verify that the sensor has been calibrated correctly.
