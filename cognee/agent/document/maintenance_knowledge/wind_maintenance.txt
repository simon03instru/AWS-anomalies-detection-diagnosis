R.M. Young Wind Monitor maintenance
Preventive maintenance for R.M. Young Wind Monitor includes:

-Checking the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer at least every second year. If the bearings are noisy or wind speed threshold increases above an acceptable level, replace the bearings.
After replacing the bearings, update the maintenance information in the Web UI.
-If the sensor measurement data looks suspicious after the maintenance operation, recalibrate the sensor.
R.M. Young suggests that the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer be
inspected at least every 24 months. Only a qualified technician should perform
the replacement.
Troubleshooting
7.1 Wind Direction
Symptom: -9999 or no change in direction
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Excitation and Single-Ended channel
specified by the measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the excitation voltage and Range code are correct for the
datalogger type.
3. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohn meter to check the
potentiometer. Resistance should be about 10K ohms between the Blue and
White wires. The resistance between either the Blue/Green or White/Green
wires should vary between 1K to 11K depending on the vane position.
Resistance when the vane is in the 5 degree dead band should be about 1 M
ohm.
Symptom: Incorrect wind direction
1. Verify that the Excitation voltage, Range code, multiplier and offset
parameters are correct for the datalogger type.
2. Check orientation of sensor, as described in Section 3.
7.2 Wind Speed
Symptom: No wind speed
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Pulse channel specified by the Pulse
count instruction.
2. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohm meter to check
the coil. The resistance between the red and black wires should be about 2075
ohms. Infinite resistance indicates an open coil; low resistance indicates a
shorted coil.
3. Verify that the Configuration Code, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for
the Pulse Count instruction are correct for the datalogger type.
Symptom: Wind speed does not change
1. For the dataloggers that are programmed with Edlog, the input location for
wind speed is not updated if the datalogger is getting “Program Table
Overruns.” Increase the execution interval (scan rate) to prevent overruns.
