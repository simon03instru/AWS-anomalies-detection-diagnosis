TIPPING BUCKET TAINGAUGE MODEL TB4 HYQUEST Solutions

The only routine maintenance required is cleaning. The following items should be checked
regularly for cleanliness:
 Catch filter
 Syphon (refer diagram 2)
 Interior of bucket
 Top surface of adjusting screws
 Enclosure locking screws - lightly lubricate after cleaning
 All insect screens


ELECTRICAL
Dual reed switches are provided for several reasons:
 Two isolated switches permit the control of two separate circuits; e.g. a local counter
and a telemetry circuit.
 Parallel connection of both switches increases the current carrying capacity of the
contact system if required.
 Parallel switch operation confers a degree of redundancy in locations where data from
the raingauge is critical to flood warning etc.

CALIBRATION
All gauges have been calibrated by Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd, prior to despatch.
The following products and services are available from Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd:
 Field Calibration Device, Model TB320, for routine field check calibrations,
supplied with operating instruction sheet refers to page FCD 110-01.
 Laboratory Calibration Unit, Model TB340, for calibration after servicing in
workshops, supplied with operating manual.
 Recalibration Service at Hyquest Solutions’ factory.
Please contact either Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd or our local distributor for further
information.


Troubleshooting
Symptom: No precipitation measurement
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count
instruction.
2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the
PulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.
Disconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check
of the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket
between the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket
is tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.
Symptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12
1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and
Table 7-3 [p. 10]).

Maintenance
During each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,
debris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.
Verify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket
tip.
Dismantling for cleaning
Regularly check the following items for cleanliness:
l Catch filter
l Siphon
l Interior of bucket
l Top surface of adjusting screws
l Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning
l Insect screens
To access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and
lifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).

2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base
Separate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the
siphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.

Disassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):
a. Unscrew nut
b. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body
c. Remove stem from siphon body
d. Unscrew cap
e. Clean all items

Reassembling the rain bucket
1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Push stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Replace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
CAUTION:
Do not over tighten.
Push filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.
5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure
the housing onto the base.

Calibration check
The sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the
adjustment screws have loosened.
Nevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting
upward on the housing.
2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.
3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated
cylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection
funnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).
4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39
times.
5. If the rain gage fails to record the correct number of tips, return the unit to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration (see Assistance at the back of this manual).
