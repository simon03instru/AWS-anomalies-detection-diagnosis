 CMP 3 Kipp and Zonen Pyranometer
Maintenance/Recalibrations
Inspect and clean the outer dome every week or so. Clean any accumulated
dust or debris off the dome and pyranometer body using a soft cloth dampened
with water or alcohol. Check that there is no condensation within the dome.
Check the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a
fault. When doing this you should be aware of several expected phenomena
that can cause strange measurements. In particular on clear, windless nights the
outer dome temperature of horizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as
the dew point temperature of the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with
the cold sky. (The effective sky temperature can be 30 °C lower than the
ground temperature, which results in an infrared emission of –150 W/m2). If
this happens, dew, glazed frost or hoar frost can be precipitated on the top of
the outer dome and can stay there for several hours in the morning. An ice cap
on the dome is a strong diffuser and can increase the pyranometer signal by up
to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.
The calibration of the CMP3 may drift with time and exposure to radiation.
Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The sensor
should be returned to Campbell Scientific, the manufacturer, or a calibration
lab with facilities to calibrate radiation sensors

Troubleshooting
Symptom: –9999 or radiation values around 0
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the terminal that is specified by the
measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the range is correct for the data logger type.
3. Measure the impedance across the red and blue sensor wires. This should
be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1 ohm/m). If the
resistance is very low there may be a short circuit (check the wiring).
Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water ingress
into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite, there is
a broken connection (check the wiring).
4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.
With the sensor located 20 cm (8 inches) below a 60 W incandescent light
bulb, the voltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a
problem with the sensor.
Symptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low
1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the
data logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual
calibration factor.
2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.
Symptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations
1. 2. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation
(radar, radio).
Check the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.
3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.



CMP6, CMP10, CMP11, CMP21 Kipp and Zonen Maintenance

Maintenance
Every week, physically inspect the pyranometer to ensure that:
• Dome is free of dirt, condensation, and ice. Remove accumulated dust,
condensation, or ice from the dome and pyranometer body by using a soft
cloth dampened with water or alcohol (FIGURE 8-1).
• The drying cartridge in the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 have orange and
opaque desiccant granules (Section 8.1.1, Changing the Desiccant (p. 16)).
• Mounting is secure.
• Pyranometer is level or is at the correct angle.
• Cables are in good condition.

Changing the Desiccant
The CMP10 has an internal drying cartridge that will last for at least ten years
if the housing is not opened. This significantly minimizes maintenance.
The drying cartridge of the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 uses desiccant that
needs to be periodically replaced. The silica gel desiccant granules in the
drying cartridge should be orange and opaque. Replace the desiccant granules
when they become translucent (normally after several months). Refill packs of
desiccant are shipped with the pyranometer and can be purchased from
Campbell Scientific. The drying cartridge uses the content of one refill pack.
FIGURE 8-2 shows the replacement process.
When changing the desiccant, ensure that:
• Surfaces touching the rubber O-ring are clean. Dirt, in combination with
water, can cause corrosion, harming it.
• Rubber O-ring is coated with silicon grease or petroleum jelly. The grease
coating improves the O-ring seal.
• Drying cartridge is tightly threaded into the pyranometer body.

Check Sensor Output
Check the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a
fault. However, several expected phenomena can cause strange measurements.
In particular, on clear, windless nights the outer dome temperature of
horizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as the dew point temperature
of the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with the cold sky. (The effective
sky temperature can be 30 °C lower than the ground temperature, which results
in an infrared emission of –150 W•m–2). If this happens, dew, glazed frost or
hoar frost can form on the top of the outer dome and can stay there for several
hours in the morning. An ice cap on the dome is a strong diffuser and can
increase the pyranometer signal by up to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.

Recalibration
The calibration of the pyranometer may drift with time and exposure to
radiation. Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The
sensor should be returned to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. Refer to the
Assistance page for information on returning the pyranometer to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: NAN, –9999, or radiation values around 0
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the differential terminal specified by the
measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the range code is correct for the data logger type.
3. Measure the impedance across the white and black sensor wires. This
should be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1
ohm•m–1). If the resistance is low, there may be a short circuit (check the
wiring). Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water
ingress into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite,
there is a broken connection (check the wiring).
4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.
With the sensor located 8 inches below a 60 W incandescent light bulb the
voltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a problem
with the sensor.
Symptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low
1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the
data logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual
calibration factor.
2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.
Symptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations
1. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation,
such as radar or radio interference.
2. Check the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.
3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.
