HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
3. Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
4. Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance
Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions for HygroVue:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed
every yea
