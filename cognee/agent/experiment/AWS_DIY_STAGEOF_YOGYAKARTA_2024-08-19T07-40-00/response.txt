Using the satellite‑based weather API for Yogyakarta (‑7.81665, 110.29481) around the requested time (2024‑08‑19T07:40:00 UTC) we retrieved the 15‑minute records at 07:30 and 07:45. The temperature was 29.0 °C at 07:30 and 28.8 °C at 07:45, giving an interpolated estimate of roughly **28.9 °C** at 07:40. Relative humidity was 58 % at 07:30 and 59 % at 07:45, so the estimated humidity is about **58.5 %**. 

The station’s sensor reported **20.92 °C** and **49.1 %** humidity at the same moment. Compared with the satellite data, the sensor temperature is about **8 °C lower** and the humidity about **9 % lower**. This sizable discrepancy (especially the temperature drop of ~9.6 °C noted in the anomaly report) strongly suggests a sensor fault or calibration issue rather than a true atmospheric condition, as the broader weather context shows a warm, humid environment typical for Yogyakarta in August. 

Therefore, the current weather conditions do **not** support the anomalously low temperature and humidity readings; the sensor is likely out of spec and should be inspected, recalibrated, or replaced.

The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor operates over a temperature range of -80 °C to +60 °C. Its accuracy is specified as ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × T) °C for temperatures between -80 °C and +20 °C, and ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × T) °C for temperatures between +20 °C and +60 °C. The reported reading of 20.92 °C falls well within the sensor’s operational range and, given the accuracy at that temperature (approximately ±0.17 °C), it is within normal limits and not indicative of a sensor fault based solely on range or accuracy considerations.

Troubleshooting guidance for a Vaisala HMP155 sensor experiencing a sudden temperature drop includes:
1. Verify correct wiring to the analog input channels.
2. Ensure the red power wire is connected to a 12 V (or SW12V) supply.
3. Measure output voltage on the yellow (temperature) and blue (humidity) wires; calculate temperature using °C = mV × 0.14 – 80.0.
4. Inspect the probe and filter for contamination (dirt, salt) and clean or replace if needed.
5. Re‑calibrate the sensor if the issue persists.
6. Check for electrical interference from nearby radios, cell phones, etc.
7. Confirm the probe is properly calibrated.
8. Verify the warmed probe is functioning to prevent condensation in high humidity.
9. Ensure correct installation with appropriate shielding (e.g., DTR503, DTR13, Stevenson screen) to protect from precipitation and radiation.
10. Confirm the sensor is operating within its specified power range (7‑28 V DC) and temperature range.
11. If an optional fast temperature probe is used, test its operation as well.

Assessment: The satellite‑based weather data for Yogyakarta at 2024‑08‑19 07:40 UTC shows temperature ~28.9 °C and relative humidity ~58.5 %, which is typical for the region. The station’s Vaisala HMP155 reported 20.92 °C and 49.1 % humidity – about 8 °C and 9 % lower respectively. The temperature deviation (~9.6 °C below the recent 30.56 °C mean) exceeds a >3σ shift and is inconsistent with the humidity trend, indicating a likely sensor fault rather than a real atmospheric event.

Sensor specs: The HMP155 operates from –80 °C to +60 °C and at 20.92 °C its accuracy is ≈±0.17 °C, so the value is technically within the instrument’s range and accuracy. However, the large offset from ambient conditions points to calibration drift, probe contamination, wiring or power issues.

Recommendations:
1. Visual inspection – check probe and filter for dirt, salt or moisture; clean or replace if needed.
2. Verify power supply (7‑28 V DC, preferably 12 V) and correct wiring of the temperature (yellow) and humidity (blue) leads.
3. Measure the sensor output voltage and recalculate temperature using the conversion formula; compare to expected value.
4. Perform a field calibration against a reference thermometer; if the error persists, recalibrate or replace the sensor.
5. Ensure the probe is installed in a proper shielded enclosure (e.g., Stevenson screen) and that the warmed‑probe heater is functioning.
6. Check for electrical interference from nearby equipment.
7. Log the sensor’s performance after corrective actions and monitor for repeat deviations.

Conclusion: The temperature reading is not supported by the surrounding weather and, despite being within the sensor’s nominal range, it likely reflects a sensor malfunction. Follow the above troubleshooting steps and consider sensor recalibration or replacement to restore reliable measurements.
