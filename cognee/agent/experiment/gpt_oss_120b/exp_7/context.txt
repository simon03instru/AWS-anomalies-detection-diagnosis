  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. The operational temperature range for the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is important to note that the Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe, and there is no maintenance required for it, indicating its robust design. Sensitivity details for the HMP155 are also not provided in the context.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor has an operational temperature range of −80 to +60 °C (−112 to +140 °F). Its sensitivity is characterized by accuracy margins: at −80 to +20 °C, the accuracy is ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × temperature) °C, and at +20 to +60 °C, it is ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × temperature) °C.


RAG Query #2:
  Query: Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor low temperature fault causes maintenance actions
  Dataset: maintenance_knowledge
  Node Sets: temperature_humidity_sensor
  Results: 2

  Retrieved Sentence Chunks:
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Low temperature faults in the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor can cause erroneous data readings, such as reporting temperatures as -9999 or NaN. These faults may arise due to contamination of the sensor element, inadequate power supply, or communication issues with the data logger. Maintenance actions include checking sensor wiring, ensuring proper power voltage, cleaning the sensor, and recalibrating the device annually.

  2. The low temperature fault in the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor can lead to maintenance actions due to its potential impact on measurement accuracy, especially since it operates in a wide temperature range (-80 … +60 °C). If the sensor fails to operate correctly in low temperatures, it may result in inaccurate humidity and temperature readings, necessitating recalibration, repairs, or replacement to ensure reliable performance for meteorological applications.
