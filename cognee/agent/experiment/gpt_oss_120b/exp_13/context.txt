  1. To diagnose and correct the constant 100% humidity failure in the Vaisala HMP155, follow these steps:

1. **Check the Wiring:** Ensure the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels and that the red power wire is connected to the correct 12V or SW12V channel.

2. **Voltage Testing:** With the red wire connected to a 12V terminal, use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires.

3. **Inspect the Sensor:** If the relative humidity reading is -9999, NaN, -80 °C, or 0%, check the wiring, voltage, and ensure the sensor is configured correctly.

4. **Clean the Sensor:** Contaminants on the sensor or filter can lead to incorrect readings. Clean the probe and filter as needed, replacing the filter if it is contaminated.

5. **Check the Calibration:** Recalibrate the HMP155 annually and verify that it has not drifted, as improper calibration can affect readings.

6. **Look for Physical Damage:** Confirm that the sensor is not physically damaged and is securely mounted.

7. **Replace Components if Necessary:** If issues persist after following the above steps, consider replacing the sensor element or other faulty components.

  2. To diagnose failure modes related to a constant 100% humidity reading in the Vaisala HMP155 probe, follow these steps:

1. **Inspect the Probe**: Check for any visible condensation or dirt on the probe, as a wet or dirty probe can lead to inaccurate measurements.
2. **Temperature Check**: Ensure the probe's additional temperature sensor is operational. A malfunctioning temperature probe may affect humidity readings.
3. **Power Supply**: Verify that the power supply is within acceptable range (7-28 V DC) and check connections.
4. **Calibration Verification**: Check if the probe has been calibrated correctly using a USB cable or with the push buttons. Recalibration may be necessary.
5. **Environmental Conditions**: Evaluate if the probe is exposed to external factors such as fog, mist, or rain that may cause false readings.
6. **Clean the Sintered Teflon Filter**: If the filter is clogged, clean or replace it to ensure proper airflow around the sensor.
7. **Check Connections**: Inspect all electrical connections, including the M12 connector and any extension cables for physical damage.
8. **Monitor for Potential Failures**: If problems persist, consider replacing the probe or sending it in for professional service.

Corrective maintenance may include cleaning the probe, recalibrating, or replacing damaged components.
