**Comprehensive Assessment**

1. **Current Weather Context (2024‑08‑19 07:40 local, Yogyakarta)**
   - Temperature: 23.8 °C
   - Surface pressure: 997.1 hPa
   - Relative humidity: 78 %
   - Wind speed (10 m): 7.0 m s⁻¹ (satellite‑derived)
   - The station’s wind‑speed sensor reported **10.511 m s⁻¹**, a spike of ~3.5 m s⁻¹ above the ambient value and >5 σ from the 10‑minute mean (1.8 m s⁻¹).
   - The expected inverse relationship between wind speed and pressure was not observed, reinforcing the likelihood of a sensor fault rather than a genuine meteorological event.

2. **Sensor Specification Limits**
   - The knowledge base does not contain the exact operational range or sensitivity for the **Young 05103‑L** anemometer, so a definitive “in‑range” judgment cannot be made from documentation.
   - However, typical Young anemometers are rated for 0‑60 m s⁻¹, so a reading of 10.511 m s⁻¹ would normally be well within the mechanical range. The anomaly is therefore more likely due to calibration, electronics, or mechanical issues rather than exceeding design limits.

3. **Troubleshooting & Maintenance Guidance**
   - **Immediate diagnostic steps** (per manufacturer guidance):
     1. Verify all wiring to the pulse channel; look for loose or corroded connections.
     2. Measure coil resistance (≈2075 Ω). An open or shorted coil indicates a faulty sensor.
     3. Confirm correct configuration code, multiplier, and offset for the Pulse Count instruction.
     4. Review data‑logger logs for program‑table overruns; adjust scan rate if necessary.
     5. Physically inspect the propeller for damage, blockage, or debris; ensure free rotation.
     6. Check stable DC excitation voltage (≤15 V) to the potentiometer and verify grounding.
     7. Examine signal‑conditioning electronics, especially during dead‑band regions.
     8. Perform a calibration check against a known reference anemometer.
   - **Corrective actions** when faults are identified:
     - Replace a damaged coil, worn bearings, or faulty potentiometer.
     - Re‑calibrate the sensor and update the multiplier/offset settings.
     - Secure all wiring and improve grounding.
     - If scan‑rate overruns are present, lower the logging frequency or increase buffer capacity.

4. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - **Short‑term** (within 1 day):
     * Conduct the wiring and coil‑resistance checks.
     * Visually inspect and clean the propeller and surrounding housing.
     * Run a quick calibration comparison with a portable, calibrated anemometer.
   - **Mid‑term** (within 1 week):
     * Review the data‑logger configuration; adjust scan rate if overruns are detected.
     * Log the next 24‑hour wind‑speed series and compare against satellite/model data to confirm the sensor’s baseline performance.
   - **Long‑term** (ongoing):
     * Implement a routine (e.g., weekly) visual inspection and monthly calibration verification.
     * Maintain a log of any spikes >3 m s⁻¹ above model values for trend analysis.
     * If the sensor repeatedly produces outliers, consider replacing it with a verified unit.

**Conclusion**: The satellite‑derived wind speed (7.0 m s⁻¹) is significantly lower than the station’s reported 10.511 m s⁻¹, confirming the flagged anomaly. While the reading is likely within the mechanical capability of the Young 05103‑L sensor, the lack of documented spec limits and the observed statistical outlier point to a probable sensor fault. Following the outlined diagnostic steps and corrective actions should resolve the issue and restore reliable wind‑speed measurements.

I examined the records for the timestamp 2024-08-19T07:40:00 at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA. No other sensor anomalies were found in the available data for that moment, so there are no additional anomalies to correlate or common causes to analyze.
