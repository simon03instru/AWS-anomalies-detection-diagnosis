  1. The Vaisala PTB110 pressure sensor is a barometer that does not require regular maintenance and has no replaceable parts. Unfortunately, specific details regarding the measurement range and accuracy limits are not provided in the context given.

  2. The Vaisala PTB110 pressure sensor specifications include different pressure ranges available for the device, but specific accuracy limits were not provided in the context. The device is also designed to operate in various temperature ranges.



  1. To diagnose implausibly low pressure values from a Vaisala PTB110, consider the following steps and corrective actions:

1. **Check Sensor Status:** Ensure that the sensor is present and functioning properly. A missing sensor can lead to erroneous readings.
2. **Review Data Integrity:** Look for any invalid data codes (e.g., -999, NaN) that may indicate issues with data collection.
3. **Adjust Sensor Settings:** If low readings persist, perform sensor adjustments to calibrate the device for accurate measurements.
4. **Investigate Environmental Factors:** Ensure that environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) are within operational limits as they can affect pressure readings.

  2. For the Vaisala PTB110 experiencing implausibly low pressure values, follow these diagnostic steps:
1. **Check Environment**: Ensure the device is operating within its specified pressure range and humidity conditions to prevent condensation that could affect readings.
2. **Calibration Check**: Verify that the barometer is properly calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. **Sensor Blockage**: Inspect the sensor for any blockages or damage that may affect its accuracy.

Corrective Actions:
1. If operating conditions are outside specifications (pressure or humidity), relocate the device to appropriate conditions.
2. If miscalibrated, recalibrate the device.
3. Clear any debris or repair the sensor if damaged.
