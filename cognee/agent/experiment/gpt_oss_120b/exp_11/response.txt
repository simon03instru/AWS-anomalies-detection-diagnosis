**Current Weather (2024‑08‑15 20:10 UTC, UGM Yogyakarta)**
- Temperature: 20.5 °C
- Surface pressure: 995.0 hPa (within the normal 995‑996 hPa range for the Vaisala PTB110)
- Relative humidity: 86 %
- Wind: 5.7 m s⁻¹ from 325° (north‑west)

**Anomalous Sensor Reading**
- Reported pressure: –9999.0 hPa – a sentinel value used by the PTB110 to indicate a communication failure or dead sensor. It is far outside any realistic atmospheric pressure and does not reflect the actual conditions.

**Sensor Specification & Operational Range**
- The PTB110 is designed for surface pressures around 950‑1050 hPa with typical accuracy of ±0.5 hPa. The –9999.0 hPa value is not a valid measurement; it signals a fault.

**Troubleshooting Guidance (from Vaisala documentation)**
1. Verify power supply voltage and continuity.
2. Inspect and reseat all wiring (RS‑485/Serial, ground, shielding).
3. Confirm data‑logger configuration (baud rate, address, data format) matches the sensor.
4. Query the sensor’s diagnostic interface for error codes/status flags.
5. Perform a loop‑back or substitute a known‑good sensor to isolate wiring vs. sensor failure.
6. Check ambient temperature/humidity limits for the sensor housing.

**Comprehensive Assessment**
- The satellite‑derived weather data shows normal atmospheric conditions; the pressure anomaly is purely a sensor‑hardware/communication issue.
- The sentinel value indicates the PTB110 is either unpowered, has a broken data link, or has suffered internal failure.
- No correlation with temperature, wind, or humidity can be established because the pressure sensor is non‑functional.

**Actionable Recommendations**
1. **Immediate Inspection** – Power down the AWS unit, verify voltage at the PTB110, and reseat all connectors.
2. **Diagnostic Test** – Use the sensor’s diagnostic command set to read status flags; if errors persist, proceed to step 3.
3. **Reset/ Firmware** – Perform a sensor reset and, if applicable, update the firmware of the data logger.
4. **Replace Sensor** – If diagnostics confirm internal failure, replace the PTB110 with a calibrated unit.
5. **Cross‑Check Future Data** – Implement an automated alert that flags any pressure reading of –9999.0 hPa or values outside 950‑1050 hPa, prompting rapid verification against nearby official stations or satellite data.
6. **Preventive Maintenance** – Schedule quarterly visual inspections of wiring and power supplies, and an annual calibration check of the pressure sensor.
7. **Documentation** – Log the fault, corrective actions taken, and update the maintenance record to aid future troubleshooting.

By following these steps the pressure data stream can be restored to reliable operation, and future anomalies will be detected and addressed promptly.
