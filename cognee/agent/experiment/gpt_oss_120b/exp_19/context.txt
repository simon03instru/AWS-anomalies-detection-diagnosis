  1. To troubleshoot sudden rainfall spikes in the HyQuest TB4 tipping bucket rain gauge, consider the following steps:
1. Check for cleanliness of the catch filter, siphon, and interior of the bucket to ensure they are free from debris.
2. Verify that the tipping bucket assembly moves freely and that it records each bucket tip correctly.
3. If there are issues with data measurement, check that the sensor is properly wired and that the PulseCount parameters on the data logger are set correctly.
4. For calibration, perform a check by pouring a known volume of water (314 cc) into the funnel to ensure the bucket tips correctly. 
5. Ensure that all electrical connections are secured, especially the SDI-12 communication cables if applicable.
Perform regular maintenance and calibration to avoid future issues.

  2. The HyQuest TB4 tipping bucket rain gauge, known for its high accuracy across varying rainfall intensities, may experience sudden rainfall spikes due to environmental factors, sensor miscalibration, or debris blockage. Troubleshooting involves checking for blockages in the collection area, ensuring accurate calibration, and inspecting the functionality of the tipping mechanism.



  1. The specifications for the HyQuest TB4 rainfall sensor include:

- **Measurement Range:** Not specified in the provided context.
- **Sensitivity:** Not specified in the provided context.
