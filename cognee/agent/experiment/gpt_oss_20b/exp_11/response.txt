The search results indicate that a -9999.0 hPa reading from a Vaisala PTB110 sensor is an invalid data sentinel value, typically caused by sensor malfunction or communication failure. Possible causes include:
1. Sensor calibration drift or failure.
2. Loose or damaged electrical connections.
3. Environmental conditions outside the sensor’s operating humidity range, leading to condensation or moisture interference.
4. Incorrect pressure range settings or incompatibility with the PTB210 model specifications.
Recommended maintenance actions:
- Verify and, if necessary, recalibrate the PTB110 sensor according to Vaisala’s calibration procedure.
- Inspect all wiring and connectors for secure attachment, corrosion, or damage; replace any faulty components.
- Check the sensor’s operating humidity and temperature conditions; ensure they remain within specified limits and address any condensation issues.
- Confirm that the pressure range settings match the expected atmospheric pressure range for the site; adjust settings or replace the sensor if incompatible.
- Perform a communication test between the sensor and the data acquisition system to rule out software or firmware issues.
- If problems persist after these steps, consider replacing the sensor with a new or refurbished unit.
