**Assessment**
- The HYQUEST TB4 rain sensor reported a 100 mm rainfall spike in a 10‑minute interval, which is inconsistent with the satellite‑derived weather data (0 mm precipitation) and indicates a spurious spike.
- Trend analysis and confidence (>80 %) confirm a sensor fault.
- The spike is within the sensor’s rated operational range (max 700 mm h⁻¹) but exceeds the typical 0–50 mm per 10‑minute interval, suggesting a malfunction rather than a real event.

**Actionable Recommendations**
1. **Regular Cleaning** – Remove debris, insects, or sediment from the collection funnel, debris screen, siphoning mechanism, and tipping bucket assembly.
2. **Check Components** – Verify that the tipping bucket assembly moves freely and that the data logger records each bucket tip accurately.
3. **Dismantling & Reassembly** – Follow the manufacturer’s cleaning procedure for disassembling and reassembling the device, ensuring the filter/siphon assembly is not twisted.
4. **Calibration Check** – Conduct a yearly calibration by verifying the gauge level and pouring a known volume of water to confirm correct tipping; recalibrate if spikes persist.
5. **Document Findings** – Record the date of inspection, any debris found, wiring status, and calibration results for future reference.

Implementing these steps should resolve the spurious spike and restore reliable rainfall measurements for AWS_DIY_UGM.
