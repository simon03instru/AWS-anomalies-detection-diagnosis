  1. The operating temperature range of the Vaisala HMP155 is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it mentions that the Pt100 temperature sensor, which is soldered to the probe, does not require maintenance according to its operating principles.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 has an operating temperature range of −80 to +60 °C (−112 to +140 °F).



  1. **Common Causes of Malfunctions:**  
1. Wiring issues, such as incorrect connections to the analog input channels.  
2. Inadequate power supply to the sensor (must be 12V).  
3. Contamination of the probe or filter, leading to inaccurate readings.  
4. Damage to the sensor element or corrosion of connectors.  

**Recommended Maintenance Actions:**  
1. Monthly checks on the radiation shield and probe for debris.  
2. Annual replacement of the probe filter and recalibration of the sensor.  
3. Cleaning the radiation shield and probe with mild detergent and a soft cloth.  
4. Regular checking of the red power wire connection and verifying wiring continuity.

  2. **Common Causes of Malfunctions:**
1. **Condensation:** The sensor may give inaccurate readings due to fog, mist, rain, or heavy dew.
2. **External Damage:** Exposure to harsh environments or failure to protect against precipitation and solar radiation can lead to sensor deterioration.
3. **Calibration Issues:** Improper calibration may cause measurement inaccuracies.

**Recommended Maintenance Actions:**
1. **Regular Calibration:** Use a computer with a USB connection or MI70 indicator for calibration.
2. **Protective Measures:** Ensure installation in appropriate radiation shields (DTR503, DTR13, Stevenson screen) to shield from elements.
3. **Visual Inspection:** Regularly check for physical signs of wear or damage and clean the sintered teflon filter as needed.
