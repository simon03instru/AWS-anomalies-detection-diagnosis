  1. To diagnose and correct the constant 100% humidity failure in the Vaisala HMP155, follow these steps:

1. **Check the Wiring:** Ensure the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels and that the red power wire is connected to the correct 12V or SW12V channel.

2. **Voltage Testing:** With the red wire connected to a 12V terminal, use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires.

3. **Inspect the Sensor:** If the relative humidity reading is -9999, NaN, -80 °C, or 0%, check the wiring, voltage, and ensure the sensor is configured correctly.

4. **Clean the Sensor:** Contaminants on the sensor or filter can lead to incorrect readings. Clean the probe and filter as needed, replacing the filter if it is contaminated.

5. **Check the Calibration:** Recalibrate the HMP155 annually and verify that it has not drifted, as improper calibration can affect readings.

6. **Look for Physical Damage:** Confirm that the sensor is not physically damaged and is securely mounted.

7. **Replace Components if Necessary:** If issues persist after following the above steps, consider replacing the sensor element or other faulty components.

  2. To diagnose failure modes related to a constant 100% humidity reading in the Vaisala HMP155 probe, follow these steps:

1. **Inspect the Probe**: Check for any visible condensation or dirt on the probe, as a wet or dirty probe can lead to inaccurate measurements.
2. **Temperature Check**: Ensure the probe's additional temperature sensor is operational. A malfunctioning temperature probe may affect humidity readings.
3. **Power Supply**: Verify that the power supply is within acceptable range (7-28 V DC) and check connections.
4. **Calibration Verification**: Check if the probe has been calibrated correctly using a USB cable or with the push buttons. Recalibration may be necessary.
5. **Environmental Conditions**: Evaluate if the probe is exposed to external factors such as fog, mist, or rain that may cause false readings.
6. **Clean the Sintered Teflon Filter**: If the filter is clogged, clean or replace it to ensure proper airflow around the sensor.
7. **Check Connections**: Inspect all electrical connections, including the M12 connector and any extension cables for physical damage.
8. **Monitor for Potential Failures**: If problems persist, consider replacing the probe or sending it in for professional service.

Corrective maintenance may include cleaning the probe, recalibrating, or replacing damaged components.



  1. The operational range sensitivity of the Vaisala HMP155 relative humidity sensor is not explicitly detailed in the provided context. However, general maintenance guidelines suggest that the sensor should be recalibrated annually, and contamination on the filter or sensor elements can significantly affect response time and measurement accuracy. Additionally, continuous exposure to air pollution and salt may necessitate more frequent maintenance.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 relative humidity sensor has an operational range of 0 to 100 %RH. Its accuracy is ±1 %RH for humidity levels of 0 to 90 %RH, and ±1.7 %RH for 90 to 100 %RH. It features a response time of 20 seconds for 63 %RH and 60 seconds for 90 %RH in still air at +20 °C.



  1. To troubleshoot a 100% humidity reading on the Vaisala HMP155, follow these steps:

1. **Check Wiring**: Ensure the sensor is properly wired to the correct analog input channels as per the measurement instructions.
2. **Verify Power Connection**: Confirm that the red power wire is connected to the 12V or SW12V channel, as required by your data logger.
3. **Inspect Probe Filter**: Check and potentially replace the probe filter if it's contaminated, as this can affect humidity readings.
4. **Check Calibration**: Recalibrate the HMP155 annually to maintain accuracy.
5. **Clean the Sensor**: If the sensor element is dirty or contaminated, clean it gently with distilled water.
6. **Avoid Environmental Factors**: Ensure the sensor is not installed near sources of electrical interference, such as radio transmitters or cell phones. 
7. **Test Output**: Use a voltmeter to measure the output voltage for temperature and humidity, ensuring the readings align with expected values.

  2. To troubleshoot a 100% humidity reading on the Vaisala HMP155, consider the following steps:

1. **Check Probe Condition**: Ensure the probe is not wet or contaminated, as a wet probe can give inaccurate readings in high humidity.

2. **Calibration**: Verify that the HMP155 is calibrated correctly. Calibration can be done using a computer with a USB cable or with the MI70 indicator.

3. **Environment Factors**: Evaluate the installation environment. Factors like fog, mist, or rain can affect readings. Ensure the probe is installed in a suitable radiation shield to protect it from precipitation and solar radiation.

4. **Warmed Probe Feature**: If applicable, ensure the warmed probe feature is functioning. This helps to prevent condensation formation on the sensor.

5. **Check Connections**: Inspect all connections to ensure they are secure and functioning correctly, including power supply and output connections.

6. **Error Codes**: If the device displays any error codes, refer to the manual for troubleshooting specific to those codes.
