The anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA on 2024‑08‑19 14:40 local (UTC+7) shows a 100 % relative humidity reading with a temperature of 30.92 °C. Weather data from the nearest satellite timestamp (07:45 UTC / 14:45 local) indicates a temperature of 29.2 °C, relative humidity of 57 %, and no rainfall. Thus the sensor reported a humidity that is 43 % higher and a temperature about 1.7 °C warmer than the actual conditions.

**Sensor compliance**: The Vaisala HMP155 operates from 0 % to 100 % RH with ±1.7 % accuracy at the upper end. A perfectly stable 100 % reading is statistically unlikely and falls at the edge of the sensor’s accuracy range, suggesting a fault rather than a true environmental condition.

**Possible causes**:
1. Probe contamination or moisture leading to a saturated reading.
2. Wiring or power issues causing erroneous output.
3. Calibration drift or failure of the warmed‑probe feature.
4. Environmental interference (e.g., precipitation, fog, solar radiation) not adequately shielded.

**Actionable recommendations**:
1. Inspect and clean the probe element; replace the filter if dirty.
2. Verify all wiring, power connections, and the warmed‑probe function.
3. Re‑calibrate the sensor according to Vaisala guidelines.
4. Ensure the radiation shield is properly installed and free of damage.
5. If the anomaly persists after these steps, replace the sensor.

Implementing these steps should resolve the 100 % RH anomaly and restore reliable humidity measurements.
