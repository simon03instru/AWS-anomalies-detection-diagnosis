**Assessment Report – AWS_DIY_UGM Temperature Anomaly**

1. **Current Weather Conditions (2024‑08‑15 19:00‑21:00 UTC)**
   - Temperature: 20.2 °C to 20.7 °C (stable, 20.5 °C at anomaly time)
   - Humidity: 85‑87 %
   - Wind: 5.5‑5.9 m s⁻¹ from NW (≈ 320°)
   - Precipitation: 0 mm
   - Solar radiation: 0 W m⁻² (nighttime)
   - Surface pressure: 994.9‑995.0 hPa

2. **Sensor Operational Range & Sensitivity**
   - Vaisala HMP155 is rated for –40 °C to +50 °C with ±0.5 °C accuracy.
   - The anomalous reading of 2.0 °C is far below the ambient 20.5 °C, exceeding the sensor’s ±3σ threshold and indicating a fault rather than a true environmental change.

3. **Troubleshooting & Maintenance Recommendations**
   - **Immediate actions**: Replace the temperature sensor module; verify wiring and connector integrity.
   - **Calibration check**: Perform a quick calibration against a reference thermometer.
   - **Software**: Update firmware to the latest version to rule out known bugs.
   - **Monitoring**: Enable self‑diagnostic logging for the next 24 h to confirm the replacement resolves the issue.

4. **Trend Analysis Context**
   - The sudden drop to 2.0 °C with no concurrent humidity rise and a broken correlation strongly points to a sensor fault.
   - No other anomalies (humidity, wind, pressure) were detected in the same period.

5. **Actionable Recommendations**
   1. Replace the HMP155 temperature sensor.
   2. Verify sensor mounting and exposure to avoid future micro‑climate effects.
   3. Schedule a quarterly calibration audit.
   4. Implement automated anomaly alerts for temperature deviations >3σ.

**Conclusion**: The anomaly is attributable to a sensor fault. Correcting the sensor and implementing preventive maintenance will restore data integrity.
