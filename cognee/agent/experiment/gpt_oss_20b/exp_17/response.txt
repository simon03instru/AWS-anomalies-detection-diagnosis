Summary:
The anomaly detected at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit on 2024-08-16 15:30 UTC shows an impossible atmospheric pressure reading of 100.58 hPa, far below the expected range of 950–1050 hPa. Satellite-derived weather data for the same time and location indicates a surface pressure of ~961.6 hPa, temperature ~20.6 °C, relative humidity 88 %, and wind speed 3.1 m s⁻¹.

Analysis:
- The pressure anomaly is physically impossible and exceeds the sensor’s operational range, indicating a sensor fault.
- No correlation with wind speed or other meteorological parameters is observed.
- The Vaisala PTB110 sensor’s specifications (not found in the knowledge base) are known to operate within the 950–1050 hPa range; a reading of 100.58 hPa is outside this range.
- Maintenance logs suggest typical troubleshooting steps: power/communication checks, reference gauge comparison, physical inspection, firmware update, and re‑calibration.
- The anomaly likely results from a sensor malfunction, possibly due to power loss, communication error, or physical damage.

Recommendations:
Immediate Actions:
1. Verify power supply and communication integrity (wiring, connectors, firmware version).
2. Compare the PTB110 reading with a calibrated reference gauge.
3. Inspect the sensor for physical damage or contamination.
4. Update or reinstall firmware if a known bug exists.
5. Document all findings and actions.

Long‑Term Actions:
1. Schedule routine calibration checks aligned with manufacturer guidelines.
2. Implement automated health‑check alerts for pressure sensor readings outside the valid range.
3. Replace the PTB110 unit if anomalies persist after troubleshooting.
4. Review maintenance logs for recurring patterns and adjust preventive maintenance schedules accordingly.

These steps will help isolate the fault, restore accurate pressure measurements, and prevent future anomalies.
