No additional sensor anomalies were found at AWS_DIY_UGM around 2024-08-15T20:10:00 UTC. 
The weather data for that time shows normal temperature (~21.9 °C), no precipitation, and zero solar radiation, consistent with night conditions. 
Since the relative humidity anomaly appears isolated, it is likely due to a sensor malfunction rather than a weather-related cause. 
No shared causes or correlations with other sensor readings were detected. 
Recommended actions include inspecting and recalibrating the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor, checking its power supply and firmware, 
and verifying its mounting and shielding from environmental factors.
