  1. To troubleshoot abrupt humidity drop failures in the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor, follow these steps:

1. **Check Wiring:** Ensure the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels according to the measurement instructions.
2. **Verify Power Supply:** Make sure the red power wire is correctly connected to a 12V or SW12V channel. Use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for temperature and relative humidity.
3. **Inspect the Probe and Filter:** Examine the probe for secure mounting, check the radiation shield for intactness, and clean or replace the filter if it is contaminated.
4. **Keep Sensor Clean:** Regularly clean the sensor and shield to prevent debris or salt buildup that can affect readings.
5. **Check for Contamination:** If measurements are inaccurate, consider contamination of the sensor element; clean it with distilled water if needed.
6. **Recalibrate Annually:** It’s recommended to recalibrate the HMP155 annually to maintain accuracy.

  2. To troubleshoot abrupt humidity drop failures in the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor, consider the following potential failure modes based on the context of the device:

1. **Warmed Probe Issues:** If the warmed probe fails to function correctly, condensation may form on the sensor, leading to inaccurate humidity readings.

2. **Environmental Factors:** High humidity environments (fog, mist, rain) can affect measurements. Ensure the sensor is protected from these conditions, possibly by verifying the sintered Teflon filter and ensuring that no moisture is entering the probe.

3. **Calibration Problems:** Check if the probe is calibrated correctly, as a significant calibration drift can lead to abrupt changes in readings.

4. **Electrical Connection Issues:** Inspect the USB and electrical connections for any faults or interruptions that might affect the sensor's performance.

5. **Chemical Purge Sensitivity:** If using the chemical purge option, make sure it's functioning properly, as chemicals can impact the sensor's accuracy.

6. **Sensor Damage:** Physically inspect the sensor for any damage or wear that could lead to failure in humidity measurement.

By addressing these factors, you can help diagnose and potentially rectify the abrupt humidity drop issue.

  1. To address sudden low humidity readings from the Vaisala HMP155, follow these calibration and repair steps:
1. **Check Wiring**: Ensure the sensor is wired correctly to the analog input channels.
2. **Verify Power Supply**: Check that the red power wire is connected to the correct terminal (12V or SW12V) to power the sensor during troubleshooting.
3. **Inspect Sensor Elements**: Look for visible contamination on the probe and filter. Clean or replace the filter if needed, and inspect the O-ring for damage.
4. **Check Measurement Parameters**: Ensure that the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the data logger settings.
5. **Sensor Calibration**: Recalibrate the HMP155 annually to maintain measurement accuracy.
6. **Environmental Considerations**: If installed near the ocean, be mindful of salt buildup that can affect humidity readings. Regularly clean the sensor components as necessary.

  2. The sudden low humidity readings from the Vaisala HMP155 may require calibration. Steps for calibration include:
1. Use a computer with a USB cable to connect to the HMP155.
2. Use the push buttons on the device for manual calibration.
3. Employ the MI70 indicator for calibration guidance.
It is important to check the probe for condensation issues, as wet probes can lead to inaccurate readings. Regular maintenance and proper installation in a suitable radiation shield can enhance measurement reliability.
