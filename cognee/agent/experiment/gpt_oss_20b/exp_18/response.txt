- Current weather at Yogyakarta (07:45 UTC, 19 Aug 2024): wind direction 156°, wind speed ~20 km/h, temperature ~28.8 °C, 
relative humidity ~59 % (satellite‑derived).\n- Anomaly: wind direction sensor reported –9999.0°, 
a sentinel value indicating communication failure; clearly outside the valid 0–360° range.\n- 
Sensor operating range: no specific data found; typical wind direction sensors cover 0–360° with ~1° resolution.\n- 
Maintenance actions (from Young 05103‑L troubleshooting guide):\n  
1. Check wiring and connections.\n  
2. Verify excitation voltage.\n  
3. Inspect potentiometer resistance.\n  
4. Check power supply stability.\n  
5. Inspect for obstructions.\n  
6. Review sensor settings in the wind monitor.\n  
7. Calibrate the sensor.\n  
8. Update firmware.\n  
9. Consult the manual.\n 
10. Contact R.M. Young support if unresolved.\n- 
Assessment: The anomalous reading is a clear sensor fault, unrelated to actual weather conditions. 
No correlation with other anomalies.\n- Actionable recommendations:\n  • Perform the listed maintenance steps immediately.\n  • 
Replace the sensor if faults persist after troubleshooting.\n  • Implement an alert for sentinel values to trigger rapid response.\n  • 
Verify sensor calibration after maintenance and monitor data continuity.
