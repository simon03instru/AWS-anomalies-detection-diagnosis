Comprehensive Assessment Report on Temperature and Solar Radiation Anomalies at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit on August 16, 2024 at 22:30

1. Summary of Anomalies:
- Temperature anomaly: Recorded temperature of 2.96°C is significantly lower than the expected night-time average of approximately 28°C for the location and time, representing a deviation of about 25°C (>3σ). This is far below the typical temperature of around 12.1°C observed at the same time.
- Solar radiation anomaly: Recorded solar radiation of 1000 W/m² at 22:30 local time (night) is physically impossible, as typical solar radiation at night is zero.

2. Sensor Specifications and Operational Range:
- Vaisala HMP155 Temperature Sensor: Operational range from -80°C to +60°C, with high sensitivity and accuracy suitable for detecting small temperature changes. The anomalous low temperature reading is within the sensor's operational range but inconsistent with environmental conditions, suggesting sensor fault or calibration error.
- Kipp & Zonen CMP3 Solar Radiation Sensor: Operational range up to 1500 W/m², capable of accurate solar radiation measurement. The 1000 W/m² reading at night is within sensor range but physically unrealistic, indicating sensor malfunction or misreading.

3. Likely Causes of Anomalies:
- Temperature sensor likely stuck at a low reading or suffering from calibration drift or error, possibly due to contamination, wiring issues, or sensor damage.
- Solar radiation sensor likely affected by sensor dome contamination (dew, frost, dirt), electrical faults, or calibration errors causing false high readings at night.

4. Potential Correlation or Common Causes:
- Both anomalies occurring simultaneously suggest a possible common cause such as environmental factors affecting sensor housings (e.g., moisture ingress, condensation), electrical issues (power supply or wiring faults), or data logger misconfiguration.
- Sensor maintenance neglect or environmental exposure could degrade both sensors concurrently.

5. Actionable Recommendations:
- For Vaisala HMP155 Temperature Sensor:
  * Verify wiring and power supply integrity.
  * Inspect and clean sensor tip and radiation shield.
  * Recalibrate sensor using appropriate calibration tools.
  * Check for condensation or moisture affecting sensor performance.
  * Replace sensor if calibration and cleaning do not resolve anomaly.

- For Kipp & Zonen CMP3 Solar Radiation Sensor:
  * Clean sensor dome regularly to remove dew, frost, dirt.
  * Inspect wiring and sensor cable for damage or shorts.
  * Verify calibration factors and recalibrate every two years.
  * Check for electromagnetic interference or improper installation.
  * Conduct performance tests to confirm sensor output consistency.

- General:
  * Review data logger settings and ensure correct sensor configuration.
  * Maintain a log of maintenance and calibration activities.
  * Consider environmental protection improvements for sensor housings.

6. Conclusion:
The temperature and solar radiation anomalies at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit on August 16, 2024 at 22:30 are caused by sensor malfunctions rather than actual environmental conditions. Both sensors are operationally suitable but likely suffer from calibration errors, contamination, or electrical faults. The simultaneous anomalies suggest common environmental or electrical causes. Prompt maintenance, cleaning, recalibration, and inspection are recommended to restore accurate sensor performance and prevent recurrence.
