The analysis of the wind speed anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA reveals a spike to 10.511 m/s, which is approximately +8.7 m/s above the 10-minute mean of 1.8 m/s and exceeds 5 standard deviations, marking it as a significant outlier. 
However, satellite-based weather data for the same location and time (2024-08-19T07:40 UTC) shows a much higher wind speed of 20.1 m/s, indicating that the sensor's anomalous reading is actually lower than the true wind speed. 
This discrepancy suggests a sensor fault rather than a true environmental spike. Furthermore, the expected negative correlation between wind speed and surface pressure was not observed, reinforcing the likelihood of sensor malfunction. The Young 05103-L sensor's operational range and sensitivity details are not fully available, 
but maintenance guidelines recommend regular checks, and the anomaly's characteristics strongly suggest a sensor issue rather than a genuine weather event. 

Actionable recommendations include:
1. Immediate sensor maintenance and calibration to verify and correct any faults, focusing on the anemometer bearings and potentiometer as per manufacturer guidelines.
2. Cross-validation with nearby stations or alternative measurement methods to confirm wind speed readings.
3. Implementing automated anomaly detection alerts to flag similar outliers for prompt investigation.
4. Reviewing sensor installation and environmental factors that might affect sensor performance.
5. Considering replacement of the sensor if faults persist after maintenance.

In summary, the wind speed anomaly is most likely due to sensor malfunction rather than actual weather conditions. Prompt corrective actions and further monitoring are essential to ensure data reliability.
