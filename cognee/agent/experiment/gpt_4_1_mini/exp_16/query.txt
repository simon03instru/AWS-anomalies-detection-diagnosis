Event Detection Time: 2024-08-19T07:40:00
Station: AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA
Location: Yogyakarta, Indonesia
Coordinates: Latitude -7.81665, Longitude 110.29481, Altitude 48.0m

1 Confirmed Anomaly with Trend Analysis:
Anomaly #1: Temperature
  Value: 0.92
  Sensor Brand: Vaisala HMP155
  Trend Analysis: Temperature sensor likely malfunction: reading 0.92°C is ~30°C below 20‑interval mean (30.6°C), >3 standard deviations, while concurrent humidity (49.1%) and solar radiation (530.6 W/m²) are normal. Correlation between low temperature and solar radiation is broken, indicating sensor fault rather than genuine weather event.
