  1. To troubleshoot low temperature anomalies and humidity issues with the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, follow these steps:

1. **Check Connections**: Ensure the sensor is wired correctly to the analog input channels.
2. **Verify Power Supply**: Confirm that the red power wire is connected to the 12V or SW12V channel and that the sensor is receiving constant power.
3. **Measure Output Voltage**: Use a voltmeter to check output voltage for temperature (yellow wire) and humidity (blue wire).
4. **Inspect the Probe Filter**: If humidity is reported incorrectly (e.g., -9999, NAN, or 0%), consider changing the probe filter as it may be contaminated or clogged.
5. **Calibration**: Recalibrate the sensor annually to ensure accuracy.
6. **Clean the Sensor**: Clean the sensor tip and radiation shield to ensure no debris or salt is affecting measurement accuracy.

By performing these checks and maintenance tasks, you can address the low temperature and humidity readings effectively.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 probe is designed for accurate humidity and temperature measurements in harsh environments. For troubleshooting low temperature anomalies with regards to humidity and solar radiation, ensure the probe is protected from precipitation and direct sunlight by using appropriate radiation shields (DTR503, DTR13, or Stevenson screen). Additionally, check calibration and the condition of the warmed probe feature, as it helps prevent condensation and ensures more reliable readings in high humidity. If issues persist, consider checking the output connections or using the USB connection for diagnostics.


  1. The Vaisala HMP155 has an operational temperature range that includes 0.92°C and a sensitivity deviation of 30°C. This indicates that the sensor can accurately measure temperature deviations within that range, which is critical for its performance.

  2. The Vaisala HMP155 has an operational temperature range of -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F) and a sensitivity of ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × temperature) °C at temperatures from +20 to +60 °C.


  1. To troubleshoot low temperature readings on the Vaisala HMP155, follow these steps:

1. **Check Wiring**: Ensure the sensor is wired correctly to the appropriate analog input channels and that the red power wire is connected to the correct 12V or SW12V channel.

2. **Verify Output Voltage**: With the red wire connected to 12V, use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires (temperature: °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity: % = mV * 0.1).

3. **Check for Contamination**: Inspect the probe's filter and sensor for contamination. Over time, debris or salt may interfere with readings.

4. **Replace the Filter**: If the filter is contaminated, remove and replace it. Ensure to check the O-ring as well.

5. **Confirm Calibration**: Recalibrate the HMP155A annually to ensure accurate readings.

6. **Inspect Sensor Element**: If temperatures are reported as -9999 or NAN, check if the sensor element is plugged in properly and free from corrosion.

  2. To troubleshoot low temperature readings with the Vaisala HMP155, consider the following steps:

1. **Check the Sensor**: Ensure that the sensor is not exposed to condensation or significant temperature gradients that might affect accuracy.
2. **Warmed Probe Option**: If the ambient humidity is near saturation, use the optional warmed humidity probe to prevent condensation.
3. **Calibration**: Ensure the probe is properly calibrated using the USB connection, push buttons, or MI70 indicator, especially if it has not been calibrated recently.
4. **Installation Shield**: Verify that the probe is installed in an appropriate radiation shield (DTR503, DTR13, or Stevenson screen) to protect from direct solar radiation.
5. **Environmental Conditions**: Make sure that the operating temperature and humidity conditions are within the specified ranges (-80 to +60 °C for temperature and 0 to 100 %RH for humidity).
6. **Connections**: Check that connections and cables are secure and compatible, as poor connections can lead to inaccurate readings. 

If issues persist, consult the product’s technical documentation or contact Vaisala support for further assistance.
