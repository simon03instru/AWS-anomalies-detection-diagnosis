The weather data for Cibubur, Indonesia around August 16, 2024, 15:30 UTC shows a temperature of approximately 12.1°C and a wind direction of about 265° at 10 meters height. Comparing this to the reported anomalies: the wind direction anomaly value of -9999.0° is clearly an invalid sentinel value indicating sensor failure, as normal wind direction values are around 265°, which is a typical and plausible reading. The temperature anomaly reported as 15.0°C is higher than the satellite-based observed temperature of around 12.1°C, but not drastically different. However, the anomaly report mentioned a 13°C drop from a 10-minute mean of 28.1°C, which suggests the sensor reading of 15.0°C is indeed an abrupt and unusual drop compared to expected conditions. In summary, the wind direction anomaly is a sensor communication failure, while the temperature anomaly represents a significant deviation from expected values, likely due to sensor malfunction. The normal weather data does not support the anomalous readings, confirming the sensor issues. Maintenance should focus on sensor diagnostics and replacement or recalibration to resolve these faults.

The Young 05103-L wind direction sensor operates within a range of 0 to 360 degrees with a resolution of 0.5 degrees. The anomalous wind direction value of -9999.0° is a sentinel value indicating sensor communication failure and is clearly outside the normal operational range of this sensor.

The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor operates within a temperature range of -80 to +60 °C. It has an accuracy that varies slightly depending on the output type but generally provides reliable measurements within this range. The reported temperature anomaly of 15.0 °C falls well within the normal operational range of the HMP155 sensor. However, the trend analysis indicates this value is a 13°C drop below the 10-minute mean and a >3σ deviation, suggesting a sensor malfunction rather than an out-of-range measurement.

In summary, the wind direction anomaly (-9999.0) is outside the sensor's operational parameters and indicates a fault, while the temperature value (15.0 °C) is within the sensor's operational range but likely represents a malfunction due to the abrupt deviation from expected values.

For the Young 05103-L wind direction sensor, common anomalies include invalid readings such as -9999 due to sensor communication failure, often caused by wiring issues, incorrect excitation voltage, or potentiometer faults. Troubleshooting steps include checking sensor wiring, verifying excitation voltage and datalogger settings, inspecting potentiometer resistance, and ensuring correct sensor orientation. Common failure modes include noisy bearings, mechanical jams, sensor drift, and electrical failures. Recommended maintenance involves inspecting and replacing bearings every 24 months, recalibrating the sensor using the Vane Angle Bench Stand, checking vane torque, and cleaning the vane to prevent obstructions.

For the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor, anomalies like abrupt temperature drops and broken correlation with humidity suggest sensor malfunction possibly due to sensor damage, contamination, or electrical failures. Troubleshooting includes checking sensor condition and connection integrity. Common failure modes include sensor drift and electrical issues. Maintenance recommendations are regular calibration per manufacturer guidelines and ensuring environmental protection to avoid damage.

Actionable maintenance recommendations:
1. For Young 05103-L: Inspect and repair wiring, verify excitation voltage and datalogger configuration, check and replace bearings if noisy, recalibrate sensor regularly, and clean the vane.
2. For Vaisala HMP155: Inspect sensor for damage or contamination, verify electrical connections, perform regular calibration, and protect sensor from harsh environmental conditions.
