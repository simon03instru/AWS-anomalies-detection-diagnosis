[32mTroubleshooting steps and failure modes for a Vaisala HMP155 that shows temperature readings significantly lower than expected while humidity remains unchanged, along with recommended maintenance actions:

**Possible Failure Modes**
1. Incorrect wiring or loose connections to the analog input channels.
2. Inadequate or unstable power supply (7‑28 V DC) to the sensor.
3. Faulty temperature‑output voltage (low voltage) due to sensor or electronics failure.
4. Calibration drift or incorrect calibration of the temperature probe.
5. Contamination of the sensor element (dust, debris, salt) affecting heat transfer.
6. Physical damage or blockage of the additional temperature probe or sintered Teflon filter.
7. Installation errors – sensor exposed to extreme conditions, electrical interference, or not properly protected.
8. Operating outside the specified temperature range (‑80 °C to +60 °C).

**Recommended Troubleshooting Steps**
1. **Check Wiring** – Verify that all sensor wires are correctly connected to the specified analog input channels as per the measurement instructions.
2. **Verify Power** – Confirm the red power wire supplies the correct voltage (12 V or SW12 V) and that the power source is stable.
3. **Measure Output Voltage** – With the sensor powered, use a voltmeter to check the temperature‑output voltage; low voltage indicates a sensor fault.
4. **Inspect Connections** – Examine the 8‑pin M12 connector and all terminals for looseness, corrosion, or damage.
5. **Examine Probe Integrity** – Look for physical damage or contamination on the temperature probe and clean any dust or salt buildup.
6. **Check Calibration** – Re‑calibrate the temperature probe using a calibrated reference (computer, MI70 indicator, or other approved method).
7. **Inspect Filters** – Ensure the sintered Teflon filter is clean and not blocked; replace if necessary.
8. **Assess Installation** – Verify the sensor is properly mounted, shielded from direct sunlight, precipitation, or electrical interference, and that it is within its operating temperature limits.
9. **Environmental Review** – Confirm that ambient conditions are not extreme (e.g., temperatures far outside the sensor’s range) which could cause erroneous readings.
10. **Professional Service** – If the above steps do not resolve the issue, arrange for detailed inspection or servicing by qualified personnel.

**Recommended Maintenance Actions**
- Perform routine visual inspections of wiring, connectors, and power supply every 6 months.
- Clean the sensor housing and temperature probe regularly, especially in dusty or salty environments.
- Replace the sintered Teflon filter according to the manufacturer’s schedule or when visual inspection shows blockage.
- Schedule calibration checks at least annually, or after any major maintenance event.
- Document any observed anomalies, corrective actions taken, and sensor performance trends in the maintenance log.
- Keep spare temperature probes and filters on hand for quick replacement.
- Ensure the sensor is installed according to the manufacturer’s mounting guidelines to avoid exposure to extreme conditions or interference.

Following these steps will help identify the root cause of low temperature readings and ensure the Vaisala HMP155 remains accurate and reliable.[39m

[32m**Assessment of Temperature Anomaly (AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA – 2024‑08‑19T07:40:00)**

1. **Current Weather vs. Sensor Reading**
   - Satellite‑derived observations for Yogyakarta at ~07:40 UTC show a temperature of ~28.9 °C (29.0 °C at 07:30, 28.8 °C at 07:45), relative humidity ~58‑59 %, no precipitation, wind ~20 km/h.
   - The Vaisala HMP155 reported 20.92 °C – about **8 °C lower** than the observed ambient temperature and **≈10 °C below the recent 30‑day mean of 30.6 °C** used in the trend analysis.
   - Humidity did not rise as would be expected if the air were truly cooler, confirming a decoupling of temperature‑humidity correlation and supporting a sensor fault.

2. **Sensor Specification Check**
   - **Operating temperature range:** –80 °C to +60 °C – the reported 20.92 °C is well within limits.
   - **Sensitivity:** not explicitly documented, but the sensor is designed for high‑accuracy meteorological measurements; a 10 °C deviation is technically possible if the sensor or its electronics are compromised.
   - Therefore, the reading is **not out‑of‑range**, but the magnitude of the deviation is **unlikely under normal operation**, indicating a probable malfunction rather than a legitimate environmental condition.

3. **Troubleshooting Findings (Vaisala HMP155)**
   - **Common failure modes for low temperature readings without humidity change:**
     1. Loose or incorrect wiring to the analog temperature output.
     2. Unstable or insufficient power supply (7‑28 V DC).
     3. Faulty temperature‑output voltage (low voltage) due to sensor/electronics degradation.
     4. Calibration drift or incorrect calibration of the temperature probe.
     5. Contamination or blockage of the temperature probe or Teflon filter.
     6. Physical damage or exposure to direct sunlight/electrical interference.
   - **Recommended diagnostic steps:**
     * Verify wiring connections and pin assignments.
     * Measure supply voltage at the sensor; confirm it meets specifications.
     * Check the temperature‑output voltage with a multimeter; compare to expected value (≈0.5 V per °C for the HMP155).
     * Inspect the probe and filter for dust, salt, or damage; clean or replace as needed.
     * Perform a calibration check against a certified reference thermometer.
     * Review installation – ensure proper shielding from solar radiation and airflow obstructions.
   - **Maintenance actions:**
     * Visual inspection of wiring and connectors every 6 months.
     * Clean probe and housing regularly, especially in dusty or humid environments.
     * Replace sintered Teflon filter per manufacturer schedule.
     * Annual calibration or after any major service.
     * Keep spare temperature probes on hand for quick swap.

4. **Comprehensive Recommendation**
   - **Immediate actions:**
     1. Power‑cycle the sensor to rule out transient power issues.
     2. Perform the wiring and voltage checks outlined above.
     3. If output voltage is low, replace the temperature probe or the entire HMP155 unit.
   - **Short‑term:** Conduct a side‑by‑side comparison with a secondary temperature sensor (e.g., a portable calibrated thermometer) for at least 24 hours to confirm the fault.
   - **Long‑term:** Implement a routine inspection and calibration schedule, and consider adding a redundant temperature sensor to the station to provide early warning of similar anomalies.
   - **Documentation:** Log the anomaly, diagnostic steps taken, and any corrective actions in the station’s maintenance record. Update the anomaly detection thresholds if the sensor’s performance history shows recurring bias.

5. **Correlation with Other Potential Anomalies**
   - No other sensor anomalies (humidity, wind, pressure) were reported for the same timestamp. The isolated nature of the temperature deviation, combined with the broken temperature‑humidity correlation, points to a **sensor‑specific issue** rather than a broader station‑wide problem.

**Bottom line:** The temperature reading of 20.92 °C is inconsistent with observed ambient conditions and is most likely caused by a fault in the Vaisala HMP155 (wiring, power, probe contamination, or calibration drift). Follow the troubleshooting steps, replace or recalibrate the sensor as needed, and institute regular maintenance to prevent recurrence.[39m

10. **Professional Service** – If the above steps do not resolve the issue, arrange for detailed inspection or servicing by qualified personnel.

**Recommended Maintenance Actions**
- Perform routine visual inspections of wiring, connectors, and power supply every 6 months.
- Clean the sensor housing and temperature probe regularly, especially in dusty or salty environments.
- Replace the sintered Teflon filter according to the manufacturer’s schedule or when visual inspection shows blockage.
- Schedule calibration checks at least annually, or after any major maintenance event.
- Document any observed anomalies, corrective actions taken, and sensor performance trends in the maintenance log.
- Keep spare temperature probes and filters on hand for quick replacement.
- Ensure the sensor is installed according to the manufacturer’s mounting guidelines to avoid exposure to extreme conditions or interference.

Following these steps will help identify the root cause of low temperature readings and ensure the Vaisala HMP155 remains accurate and reliable.

**Assessment of Temperature Anomaly (AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA – 2024‑08‑19T07:40:00)**

1. **Current Weather vs. Sensor Reading**
   - Satellite‑derived observations for Yogyakarta at ~07:40 UTC show a temperature of ~28.9 °C (29.0 °C at 07:30, 28.8 °C at 07:45), relative humidity ~58‑59 %, no precipitation, wind ~20 km/h.
   - The Vaisala HMP155 reported 20.92 °C – about **8 °C lower** than the observed ambient temperature and **≈10 °C below the recent 30‑day mean of 30.6 °C** used in the trend analysis.
   - Humidity did not rise as would be expected if the air were truly cooler, confirming a decoupling of temperature‑humidity correlation and supporting a sensor fault.

2. **Sensor Specification Check**
   - **Operating temperature range:** –80 °C to +60 °C – the reported 20.92 °C is well within limits.
   - **Sensitivity:** not explicitly documented, but the sensor is designed for high‑accuracy meteorological measurements; a 10 °C deviation is technically possible if the sensor or its electronics are compromised.
   - Therefore, the reading is **not out‑of‑range**, but the magnitude of the deviation is **unlikely under normal operation**, indicating a probable malfunction rather than a legitimate environmental condition.

3. **Troubleshooting Findings (Vaisala HMP155)**
   - **Common failure modes for low temperature readings without humidity change:**
     1. Loose or incorrect wiring to the analog temperature output.
     2. Unstable or insufficient power supply (7‑28 V DC).
     3. Faulty temperature‑output voltage (low voltage) due to sensor/electronics degradation.
     4. Calibration drift or incorrect calibration of the temperature probe.
     5. Contamination or blockage of the temperature probe or Teflon filter.
     6. Physical damage or exposure to direct sunlight/electrical interference.
   - **Recommended diagnostic steps:**
     * Verify wiring connections and pin assignments.
     * Measure supply voltage at the sensor; confirm it meets specifications.
     * Check the temperature‑output voltage with a multimeter; compare to expected value (≈0.5 V per °C for the HMP155).
     * Inspect the probe and filter for dust, salt, or damage; clean or replace as needed.
     * Perform a calibration check against a certified reference thermometer.
     * Review installation – ensure proper shielding from solar radiation and airflow obstructions.
   - **Maintenance actions:**
     * Visual inspection of wiring and connectors every 6 months.
     * Clean probe and housing regularly, especially in dusty or humid environments.
     * Replace sintered Teflon filter per manufacturer schedule.
     * Annual calibration or after any major service.
     * Keep spare temperature probes on hand for quick swap.

4. **Comprehensive Recommendation**
   - **Immediate actions:**
     1. Power‑cycle the sensor to rule out transient power issues.
     2. Perform the wiring and voltage checks outlined above.
     3. If output voltage is low, replace the temperature probe or the entire HMP155 unit.
   - **Short‑term:** Conduct a side‑by‑side comparison with a secondary temperature sensor (e.g., a portable calibrated thermometer) for at least 24 hours to confirm the fault.
   - **Long‑term:** Implement a routine inspection and calibration schedule, and consider adding a redundant temperature sensor to the station to provide early warning of similar anomalies.
   - **Documentation:** Log the anomaly, diagnostic steps taken, and any corrective actions in the station’s maintenance record. Update the anomaly detection thresholds if the sensor’s performance history shows recurring bias.

5. **Correlation with Other Potential Anomalies**
   - No other sensor anomalies (humidity, wind, pressure) were reported for the same timestamp. The isolated nature of the temperature deviation, combined with the broken temperature‑humidity correlation, points to a **sensor‑specific issue** rather than a broader station‑wide problem.

**Bottom line:** The temperature reading of 20.92 °C is inconsistent with observed ambient conditions and is most likely caused by a fault in the Vaisala HMP155 (wiring, power, probe contamination, or calibration drift). Follow the troubleshooting steps, replace or recalibrate the sensor as needed, and institute regular maintenance to prevent recurrence.

    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
