Result:
    The Vaisala HMP155 has a low-temperature bias regarding its operational temperature range accuracy, while the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer can experience false positives in its solar radiation measurements at night.
    
    The Vaisala HMP155 has an operational temperature range of −80 to +60 °C (−112 to +140 °F) with an accuracy of ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × temperature) °C at −80 to +20 °C and ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × temperature) °C at +20 to +60 °C. Its low temperature bias can result in inaccuracies, especially below −40 °C.
    
    For the Kipp & Zonen CMP3 solar radiation sensor, there is a risk of night-time false positives when measuring solar radiation in the absence of sunlight or artificial light sources, which could lead to erroneous readings.

Result:
    **Vaisala HMP155 Calibration Error & Troubleshooting:** 1. Ensure proper wiring and connection to the data logger; 2. Check calibration factors; 3. Inspect for short circuits or broken connections; 4. Verify voltage output by testing with a light source.  
    
    **Kipp & Zonen CMP3 Calibration Error & Troubleshooting:** 1. Confirm wiring to the correct terminal; 2. Check impedance should be around 100 ohms plus cable resistance; 3. Measure voltage output; 4. Inspect sensor cable for damage; 5. Recalibrate every two years.
    
    For troubleshooting calibration errors and sensor issues with the Vaisala HMP155 and Kipp & Zonen CMP3:
    
    1. **HMP155 Calibration Error (Vaisala HUMICAPâ 180R sensor):** Ensure the probe is properly calibrated using a USB connection, push buttons, or through the MI70 indicator. For humidity measurements, verify that the sensor is not affected by condensation or humidity saturation. A warmed probe may be necessary in high-humidity environments to ensure accurate readings. Regular calibration and maintenance are crucial for long-term stability.
    
    2. **CMP3 Calibration Error:** Refer to Kipp & Zonen's documentation for specific calibration procedures or troubleshooting tips, as details for the CMP3 were not provided in the context. Generally, check for environmental factors, probe cleanliness, and proper connections as foundational checks.

[32mI retrieved the observed weather data for the requested location and time window (2024-08-16 14:30‑16:30 UTC). At the exact timestamp of the anomaly (2024‑08‑16 15:30 UTC) the satellite‑based observations show:
- Temperature: **12.1 °C** (well above the reported 2.96 °C)
- Direct solar radiation: **0 W/m²** (nighttime, matching the expected darkness; the reported 1000 W/m² is impossible)
- Relative humidity: **88 %**
- Wind speed at 10 m: **22.0 m s⁻¹**
These values are consistent with typical nighttime conditions for the region (cool but not near‑freezing, no solar radiation, high humidity, moderate wind). The sensor‑reported temperature is about 9 °C lower than the observed value, and the solar radiation reading is dramatically erroneous. This strongly supports the anomaly analysis that the temperature sensor is likely stuck low or mis‑calibrated, and the solar radiation sensor is malfunctioning (reading daylight values at night). No further data suggests any other environmental cause for these discrepancies.

**Assessment & Recommendations**
1. **Sensor verification** – Perform an on‑site calibration check of the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor and replace or recalibrate if it continues to read below ambient.
2. **Solar radiation sensor** – The Kipp & Zonen CMP3 is reporting 1000 W/m² at night, which is outside its operational range (0‑~1200 W/m² during daylight). Inspect the sensor housing for shading, power issues, or firmware glitches; consider swapping with a spare unit.
3. **Cross‑check with nearby stations** – Compare readings with the nearest AWS or meteorological station to confirm ambient conditions (should show ~12 °C, 0 W/m² SR).
4. **Data quality flagging** – Flag the affected timestamps in the data stream and exclude them from any downstream analysis until the sensors are serviced.
5. **Maintenance schedule** – Add these sensors to the next preventive maintenance cycle, and log the incident in the equipment maintenance database.

Overall, the observed weather data clearly contradicts the anomalous sensor outputs, indicating sensor faults rather than unusual meteorological events.[39m

[32m**Assessment**
- The satellite‑derived weather at the time of the event (2024‑08‑16 15:30 UTC, local night) was ~12 °C temperature, 0 W/m² solar radiation, 88 % RH and 22 m s⁻¹ wind. The reported sensor values (2.96 °C and 1000 W/m²) are far outside the ambient conditions, confirming the anomalies identified by the trend analysis.
- The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor is operating well within its –80 °C to +60 °C range, but the reading is ~9 °C low, suggesting a sensor‑stuck or calibration error rather than a true extreme. The known low‑temperature bias below –40 °C does not apply here.
- The Kipp & Zonen CMP3 pyranometer also operates within its 0‑2000 W/m² range, yet it reports a full‑daylight value at night, a classic false‑positive failure mode for this model.

**Possible Common Cause**
- Both sensors share the same data‑logger and power feed. A transient power‑supply glitch, grounding issue, or data‑logger firmware fault could corrupt analog‑to‑digital conversion, causing the temperature sensor to read low and the pyranometer to output a default daylight voltage. Wiring faults (loose connectors, corrosion) could produce similar simultaneous errors.

**Actionable Recommendations**
*Immediate Verification*:
1. Inspect and reseat all sensor cables, connectors, and the data‑logger power supply; measure supply voltage stability.
2. Perform a quick on‑site calibration check of the HMP155 (use the built‑in calibration routine or a reference thermometer) and verify the CMP3 output voltage against a known dark condition.
3. Swap the HMP155 and CMP3 with known‑good spare units, if available, to see if the anomalies persist.
4. Cross‑check the current readings with the nearest AWS or nearby reference station to confirm ambient conditions.
5. Flag the 2024‑08‑16 15:30 UTC timestamp in the data stream and exclude it from analyses until the issue is resolved.

*Long‑Term Mitigation*:
1. Implement automated QC rules that trigger alerts when temperature deviates >5 °C from nearby stations or when solar radiation >0 W/m² during night hours.
2. Schedule regular (quarterly) visual inspections of sensor housings, wiring, and power supplies, and annual recalibration of both sensors per manufacturer guidance.
3. Maintain a spare HMP155 and CMP3 on‑site for rapid replacement.
4. Log all incidents in the maintenance database and track recurring power‑supply or data‑logger faults; consider upgrading to a redundant data‑logger or isolated power modules if failures repeat.
5. Document the troubleshooting steps taken and update SOPs to include the specific checks for simultaneous temperature‑low and solar‑radiation‑high anomalies.

By addressing the immediate wiring/power‑supply checks and establishing robust QC and maintenance practices, the likelihood of repeat anomalies can be substantially reduced.[39m

1. Implement automated QC rules that trigger alerts when temperature deviates >5 °C from nearby stations or when solar radiation >0 W/m² during night hours.
2. Schedule regular (quarterly) visual inspections of sensor housings, wiring, and power supplies, and annual recalibration of both sensors per manufacturer guidance.
3. Maintain a spare HMP155 and CMP3 on‑site for rapid replacement.
4. Log all incidents in the maintenance database and track recurring power‑supply or data‑logger faults; consider upgrading to a redundant data‑logger or isolated power modules if failures repeat.
5. Document the troubleshooting steps taken and update SOPs to include the specific checks for simultaneous temperature‑low and solar‑radiation‑high anomalies.

By addressing the immediate wiring/power‑supply checks and establishing robust QC and maintenance practices, the likelihood of repeat anomalies can be substantially reduced.

    1. CMP 3 Kipp and Zonen Pyranometer
Maintenance/Recalibrations
Inspect and clean the outer dome every week or so. Clean any accumulated
dust or debris off the dome and pyranometer body using a soft cloth dampened
with water or alcohol. Check that there is no condensation within the dome.
Check the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a
fault. When doing this you should be aware of several expected phenomena
that can cause strange measurements. In particular on clear, windless nights the
outer dome temperature of horizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as
the dew point temperature of the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with
the cold sky. (The effective sky temperature can be 30 °C lower than the
ground temperature, which results in an infrared emission of –150 W/m2). If
this happens, dew, glazed frost or hoar frost can be precipitated on the top of
the outer dome and can stay there for several hours in the morning. An ice cap
on the dome is a strong diffuser and can increase the pyranometer signal by up
to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.
The calibration of the CMP3 may drift with time and exposure to radiation.
Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The sensor
should be returned to Campbell Scientific, the manufacturer, or a calibration
lab with facilities to calibrate radiation sensors

Troubleshooting
Symptom: –9999 or radiation values around 0
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the terminal that is specified by the
measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the range is correct for the data logger type.
3. Measure the impedance across the red and blue sensor wires. This should
be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1 ohm/m). If the
resistance is very low there may be a short circuit (check the wiring).
Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water ingress
into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite, there is
a broken connection (check the wiring).
4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.
With the sensor located 20 cm (8 inches) below a 60 W incandescent light
bulb, the voltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a
problem with the sensor.
Symptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low
1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the
data logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual
calibration factor.
2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.
Symptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations
1. 2. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation
(radar, radio).
Check the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.
3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.



CMP6, CMP10, CMP11, CMP21 Kipp and Zonen Maintenance

Maintenance
Every week, physically inspect the pyranometer to ensure that:
• Dome is free of dirt, condensation, and ice. Remove accumulated dust,
condensation, or ice from the dome and pyranometer body by using a soft
cloth dampened with water or alcohol (FIGURE 8-1).
• The drying cartridge in the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 have orange and
opaque desiccant granules (Section 8.1.1, Changing the Desiccant (p. 16)).
• Mounting is secure.
• Pyranometer is level or is at the correct angle.
• Cables are in good condition.

Changing the Desiccant
The CMP10 has an internal drying cartridge that will last for at least ten years
if the housing is not opened. This significantly minimizes maintenance.
The drying cartridge of the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 uses desiccant that
needs to be periodically replaced. The silica gel desiccant granules in the
drying cartridge should be orange and opaque. Replace the desiccant granules
when they become translucent (normally after several months). Refill packs of
desiccant are shipped with the pyranometer and can be purchased from
Campbell Scientific. The drying cartridge uses the content of one refill pack.
FIGURE 8-2 shows the replacement process.
When changing the desiccant, ensure that:
• Surfaces touching the rubber O-ring are clean. Dirt, in combination with
water, can cause corrosion, harming it.
• Rubber O-ring is coated with silicon grease or petroleum jelly. The grease
coating improves the O-ring seal.
• Drying cartridge is tightly threaded into the pyranometer body.

Check Sensor Output
Check the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a
fault. However, several expected phenomena can cause strange measurements.
In particular, on clear, windless nights the outer dome temperature of
horizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as the dew point temperature
of the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with the cold sky. (The effective
sky temperature can be 30 °C lower than the ground temperature, which results
in an infrared emission of –150 W•m–2). If this happens, dew, glazed frost or
hoar frost can form on the top of the outer dome and can stay there for several
hours in the morning. An ice cap on the dome is a strong diffuser and can
increase the pyranometer signal by up to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.

Recalibration
The calibration of the pyranometer may drift with time and exposure to
radiation. Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The
sensor should be returned to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. Refer to the
Assistance page for information on returning the pyranometer to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: NAN, –9999, or radiation values around 0
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the differential terminal specified by the
measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the range code is correct for the data logger type.
3. Measure the impedance across the white and black sensor wires. This
should be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1
ohm•m–1). If the resistance is low, there may be a short circuit (check the
wiring). Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water
ingress into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite,
there is a broken connection (check the wiring).
4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.
With the sensor located 8 inches below a 60 W incandescent light bulb the
voltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a problem
with the sensor.
Symptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low
1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the
data logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual
calibration factor.
2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.
Symptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations
1. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation,
such as radar or radio interference.
2. Check the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.
3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
