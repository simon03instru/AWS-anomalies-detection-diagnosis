[32mResponse from Worker node 1e256205-1728-495a-9ab6-62c35c0d8efb (Weather data analysis):[39m

[32mI retrieved the weather data for Cibubur (lat -34.9285, lon 138.6007) around the requested time (2024-08-16T15:30:00Z). The 15‑minute interval values are:
- Wind direction: 264° at 15:00, 264° at 15:15, 265° at 15:30, 265° at 15:45, 266° at 16:00.
- Temperature: 12.2 °C at 15:00, then steady around 12.1 °C through 16:00.
- Relative humidity: consistently 88 %.
- Surface pressure: about 1006 hPa (1006.0‑1006.2 hPa).

Comparing to the sensor readings reported for the anomaly:
- Wind direction sensor reported -9999°, which is a sentinel error code indicating a communication failure. The actual wind direction from the weather model is around 265°, a normal value.
- Temperature sensor reported 15 °C, whereas the ambient temperature from the model is about 12.1 °C, a difference of ~3 °C. This discrepancy, together with the trend analysis indicating a 13 °C drop relative to the 10‑minute mean, suggests the temperature sensor is likely malfunctioning.

Overall, the weather data do not support the anomalous sensor values; both the wind direction and temperature readings appear erroneous.

[32m### Comprehensive Assessment of Anomalies at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit (2024‑08‑16T15:30:00)

**1. Summary of Findings**
- **Wind‑direction sensor (Young 05103‑L)** reported a sentinel value of **‑9999°**, which the sensor specification identifies as a communication‑failure code. The model‑derived weather data shows a normal wind direction of **~265°** (steady across the 15‑minute interval), confirming that the environment was within the sensor’s measurement range (0‑360°) and there was no abnormal wind event.
- **Temperature sensor (Vaisala HMP155)** reported **15 °C** while the surrounding air temperature from the weather model was **≈12.1 °C**. The trend analysis flagged a **13 °C drop** relative to the 10‑minute mean of **28.1 °C**, indicating an abrupt, unrealistic spike. The sensor’s operational range (‑80 °C to +60 °C) and its accuracy (≈±0.19 °C at 12 °C) make a 3 °C offset and a 13 °C instantaneous change impossible under normal conditions.

**2. Operational‑Range Check**
- **Young 05103‑L**: Valid range 0‑360°, resolution 0.5°. The sentinel value is outside this range and is defined as an error, confirming a fault rather than a legitimate measurement.
- **Vaisala HMP155**: Valid range ‑80 °C to +60 °C, accuracy ±0.19 °C at the observed temperature. The reported 15 °C is **~3 °C higher** than the ambient temperature and the abrupt 13 °C deviation far exceeds the sensor’s accuracy and response time (63 % step change <20 s). Hence the reading is inconsistent with both the sensor’s specifications and the actual weather.

**3. Potential Common Causes**
| Possible Cause | Why it could affect both sensors |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Power‑supply irregularities** (voltage drops, noise) | Both sensors rely on the same datalogger power rails; fluctuations can cause communication loss (‑9999) and erratic ADC conversion for temperature. |
| **Wiring or connector faults** (loose, corrosion, water ingress) | A compromised cable bundle can introduce intermittent resistance, leading to loss of signal for wind direction and spurious voltage for temperature. |
| **Data‑logger configuration / firmware bug** | Incorrect excitation voltage settings for the Young sensor or mis‑configured analog input scaling for the HMP155 can produce sentinel outputs and false temperature spikes. |
| **Environmental contamination** (dust, moisture, condensation) | The HMP155 heater failure or condensation on the probe can cause temperature drift; excessive moisture on the Young sensor’s wiring harness can short the signal, triggering the ‑9999 code. |
| **Electromagnetic interference (EMI)** from nearby equipment | EMI can corrupt serial/analog communication, resulting in both a sentinel error and sudden temperature jumps. |

**4. Immediate (Short‑Term) Actions**
1. **Inspect and reseat all cables** for the two sensors – verify continuity, correct polarity, and absence of corrosion.
2. **Measure excitation voltage** at the Young sensor terminals; ensure it matches the sensor’s required range (typically 5‑12 V). Adjust datalogger settings if out of spec.
3. **Check power rail stability** with a multimeter or data‑logger log; look for voltage dips >0.5 V.
4. **Perform a sensor reset** via the datalogger software to clear any latched error states.
5. **Visually inspect the HMP155 probe** for condensation, debris, or damaged heating element; clean or replace the filter/shield if needed.
6. **Temporarily replace the suspect sensors** with known‑good spares to confirm whether the fault is sensor‑specific or systemic.
7. **Log the raw ADC values** for the temperature channel for the next hour to see if the anomaly recurs.

**5. Longer‑Term (Preventive / Mitigation) Recommendations**
- **Implement a routine calibration schedule** (annual for HMP155, biennial for Young wind vane) and record calibration certificates.
- **Add redundancy**: install a secondary temperature sensor (e.g., a PT100) and a backup wind‑direction sensor to cross‑validate data.
- **Upgrade wiring** to shielded, UV‑rated cables with proper strain‑relief fittings to reduce EMI and moisture ingress.
- **Deploy a power‑conditioning module** (UPS or line‑filter) for the datalogger to protect against voltage transients.
- **Configure automated alerts** for sentinel values (‑9999) and temperature deviations >3 σ from the 10‑minute rolling mean, enabling faster response.
- **Document a maintenance log** that captures each inspection, wiring test, and sensor replacement; use it to track sensor age and failure trends.
- **Review site placement**: ensure the HMP155 probe remains within a ventilated radiation shield and that the Young wind vane is free from obstructions (e.g., nearby structures or vegetation) that could affect signal quality.

**6. Correlation Assessment**
Both anomalies occurred simultaneously, suggesting a **systemic issue** rather than isolated sensor failures. The most plausible shared root cause is a **power or wiring fault** affecting the datalogger’s sensor interfaces, potentially compounded by environmental moisture. Addressing the common infrastructure (power, cabling, datalogger configuration) should resolve both problems and improve overall data reliability.

**Conclusion**
The weather model data contradicts the sensor outputs, confirming that the wind‑direction reading of ‑9999° and the temperature spike to 15 °C are sensor‑fault artifacts. Immediate inspection of power and wiring, followed by sensor resets and cleaning, is recommended. Long‑term actions focus on preventive maintenance, redundancy, and robust power/communication design to mitigate future anomalies.[39m

FINAL OUTPUT - SYNTHESIZED RESULT
================================================================================
--- Subtask 13b03b47-dcce-492c-be7b-ed574a6e56b3.1 Result ---
I retrieved the weather data for Cibubur (lat -34.9285, lon 138.6007) around the requested time (2024-08-16T15:30:00Z). The 15‑minute interval values are:
- Wind direction: 264° at 15:00, 264° at 15:15, 265° at 15:30, 265° at 15:45, 266° at 16:00.
- Temperature: 12.2 °C at 15:00, then steady around 12.1 °C through 16:00.
- Relative humidity: consistently 88 %.
- Surface pressure: about 1006 hPa (1006.0‑1006.2 hPa).

Comparing to the sensor readings reported for the anomaly:
- Wind direction sensor reported -9999°, which is a sentinel error code indicating a communication failure. The actual wind direction from the weather model is around 265°, a normal value.
- Temperature sensor reported 15 °C, whereas the ambient temperature from the model is about 12.1 °C, a difference of ~3 °C. This discrepancy, together with the trend analysis indicating a 13 °C drop relative to the 10‑minute mean, suggests the temperature sensor is likely malfunctioning.

Overall, the weather data do not support the anomalous sensor values; both the wind direction and temperature readings appear erroneous.

The Young 05103-L wind direction sensor has a measurement range of 0 to 360 degrees and a resolution of 0.5 degrees. Sentinel error codes include -9999 (indicating a sensor communication failure) and a condition of no change in direction, which suggests wiring, excitation voltage, or resistance issues.

The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor operates over a temperature range of -80 °C to +60 °C (-112 °F to +140 °F). Its temperature accuracy is specified as:
- For -80 °C to +20 °C: ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × temperature) °C
- For +20 °C to +60 °C: ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × temperature) °C
Typical response characteristics are fast, reaching 63 % of a step change in less than 20 seconds and 90 % in less than 35 seconds under airflow conditions.

These specifications can be used to assess whether the observed temperature anomaly (15 °C reading, a 13 °C drop below the 10‑minute mean) falls within the sensor’s operational range and accuracy, and to evaluate if the response time aligns with the abrupt change reported.

Maintenance and troubleshooting guidance for the Young 05103‑L wind direction sensor addressing communication failures or invalid sentinel values like –9999 includes:
1. Verify proper wiring to the Excitation and Single‑Ended channel as per sensor specifications.
2. Check excitation voltage and range code settings on the datalogger.
3. Disconnect the sensor and measure resistance with an ohm‑meter:
   - Approximately 10 kΩ between the Blue and White wires.
   - Variable resistance (1 kΩ to 11 kΩ) between Blue/Green or White/Green depending on vane position.
   - About 1 MΩ in the dead‑band region.
4. Ensure all cable connections are secure and undamaged.
5. Confirm the sensor is receiving adequate power.
6. Perform a sensor reset to clear any error states.
7. Verify software/configuration settings recognize the sensor correctly.
8. If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider recalibrating the sensor after maintenance or replacing the unit if it is defective.

Maintenance and troubleshooting procedures for the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor when it shows abrupt temperature deviations or loss of correlation with humidity:
1. Check wiring: ensure correct connection to analog input channels.
2. Verify power supply: confirm red power wire to 12V/SW12V, test voltage on yellow (temperature) and blue (humidity) wires.
3. Inspect sensor element: ensure proper plug‑in, orientation, and no water or corrosion under connector.
4. Clean or replace filter: remove dust, debris, or salt buildup; clean with distilled water if contaminated.
5. Ensure probe warming function is operating: a failed heater can cause condensation and measurement errors.
6. Check for condensation on probe and ensure continuous warming to prevent it.
7. Verify calibration: confirm the HMP155 has been calibrated correctly and schedule annual recalibration.
8. Assess environmental factors: protect sensor with appropriate radiation shield (DTR503, DTR13, or Stevenson screen) to minimize fog, rain, or heavy dew effects.
9. Inspect for mechanical damage or wiring issues that could affect performance.
Follow these steps to identify the cause of abrupt temperature deviation and restore proper sensor function.

### Comprehensive Assessment of Anomalies at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit (2024‑08‑16T15:30:00)

**1. Summary of Findings**
- **Wind‑direction sensor (Young 05103‑L)** reported a sentinel value of **‑9999°**, which the sensor specification identifies as a communication‑failure code. The model‑derived weather data shows a normal wind direction of **~265°** (steady across the 15‑minute interval), confirming that the environment was within the sensor’s measurement range (0‑360°) and there was no abnormal wind event.
- **Temperature sensor (Vaisala HMP155)** reported **15 °C** while the surrounding air temperature from the weather model was **≈12.1 °C**. The trend analysis flagged a **13 °C drop** relative to the 10‑minute mean of **28.1 °C**, indicating an abrupt, unrealistic spike. The sensor’s operational range (‑80 °C to +60 °C) and its accuracy (≈±0.19 °C at 12 °C) make a 3 °C offset and a 13 °C instantaneous change impossible under normal conditions.

**2. Operational‑Range Check**
- **Young 05103‑L**: Valid range 0‑360°, resolution 0.5°. The sentinel value is outside this range and is defined as an error, confirming a fault rather than a legitimate measurement.
- **Vaisala HMP155**: Valid range ‑80 °C to +60 °C, accuracy ±0.19 °C at the observed temperature. The reported 15 °C is **~3 °C higher** than the ambient temperature and the abrupt 13 °C deviation far exceeds the sensor’s accuracy and response time (63 % step change <20 s). Hence the reading is inconsistent with both the sensor’s specifications and the actual weather.

**3. Potential Common Causes**
| Possible Cause | Why it could affect both sensors |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Power‑supply irregularities** (voltage drops, noise) | Both sensors rely on the same datalogger power rails; fluctuations can cause communication loss (‑9999) and erratic ADC conversion for temperature. |
| **Wiring or connector faults** (loose, corrosion, water ingress) | A compromised cable bundle can introduce intermittent resistance, leading to loss of signal for wind direction and spurious voltage for temperature. |
| **Data‑logger configuration / firmware bug** | Incorrect excitation voltage settings for the Young sensor or mis‑configured analog input scaling for the HMP155 can produce sentinel outputs and false temperature spikes. |
| **Environmental contamination** (dust, moisture, condensation) | The HMP155 heater failure or condensation on the probe can cause temperature drift; excessive moisture on the Young sensor’s wiring harness can short the signal, triggering the ‑9999 code. |
| **Electromagnetic interference (EMI)** from nearby equipment | EMI can corrupt serial/analog communication, resulting in both a sentinel error and sudden temperature jumps. |

**4. Immediate (Short‑Term) Actions**
1. **Inspect and reseat all cables** for the two sensors – verify continuity, correct polarity, and absence of corrosion.
2. **Measure excitation voltage** at the Young sensor terminals; ensure it matches the sensor’s required range (typically 5‑12 V). Adjust datalogger settings if out of spec.
3. **Check power rail stability** with a multimeter or data‑logger log; look for voltage dips >0.5 V.
4. **Perform a sensor reset** via the datalogger software to clear any latched error states.
5. **Visually inspect the HMP155 probe** for condensation, debris, or damaged heating element; clean or replace the filter/shield if needed.
6. **Temporarily replace the suspect sensors** with known‑good spares to confirm whether the fault is sensor‑specific or systemic.
7. **Log the raw ADC values** for the temperature channel for the next hour to see if the anomaly recurs.

**5. Longer‑Term (Preventive / Mitigation) Recommendations**
- **Implement a routine calibration schedule** (annual for HMP155, biennial for Young wind vane) and record calibration certificates.
- **Add redundancy**: install a secondary temperature sensor (e.g., a PT100) and a backup wind‑direction sensor to cross‑validate data.
- **Upgrade wiring** to shielded, UV‑rated cables with proper strain‑relief fittings to reduce EMI and moisture ingress.
- **Deploy a power‑conditioning module** (UPS or line‑filter) for the datalogger to protect against voltage transients.
- **Configure automated alerts** for sentinel values (‑9999) and temperature deviations >3 σ from the 10‑minute rolling mean, enabling faster response.
- **Document a maintenance log** that captures each inspection, wiring test, and sensor replacement; use it to track sensor age and failure trends.
- **Review site placement**: ensure the HMP155 probe remains within a ventilated radiation shield and that the Young wind vane is free from obstructions (e.g., nearby structures or vegetation) that could affect signal quality.

Both anomalies occurred simultaneously, suggesting a **systemic issue** rather than isolated sensor failures. The most plausible shared root cause is a **power or wiring fault** affecting the datalogger’s sensor interfaces, potentially compounded by environmental moisture.

  Document Chunks:
    1. R.M. Young Wind Monitor maintenance
Preventive maintenance for R.M. Young Wind Monitor includes:

-Checking the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer at least every second year. If the bearings are noisy or wind speed threshold increases above an acceptable level, replace the bearings.
After replacing the bearings, update the maintenance information in the Web UI.
-If the sensor measurement data looks suspicious after the maintenance operation, recalibrate the sensor.
R.M. Young suggests that the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer be
inspected at least every 24 months. Only a qualified technician should perform
the replacement.
Troubleshooting
7.1 Wind Direction
Symptom: -9999 or no change in direction
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Excitation and Single-Ended channel
specified by the measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the excitation voltage and Range code are correct for the
datalogger type.
3. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohn meter to check the
potentiometer. Resistance should be about 10K ohms between the Blue and
White wires. The resistance between either the Blue/Green or White/Green
wires should vary between 1K to 11K depending on the vane position.
Resistance when the vane is in the 5 degree dead band should be about 1 M
ohm.
Symptom: Incorrect wind direction
1. Verify that the Excitation voltage, Range code, multiplier and offset
parameters are correct for the datalogger type.
2. Check orientation of sensor, as described in Section 3.
7.2 Wind Speed
Symptom: No wind speed
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Pulse channel specified by the Pulse
count instruction.
2. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohm meter to check
the coil. The resistance between the red and black wires should be about 2075
ohms. Infinite resistance indicates an open coil; low resistance indicates a
shorted coil.
3. Verify that the Configuration Code, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for
the Pulse Count instruction are correct for the datalogger type.
Symptom: Wind speed does not change
1. For the dataloggers that are programmed with Edlog, the input location for
wind speed is not updated if the datalogger is getting “Program Table
Overruns.” Increase the execution interval (scan rate) to prevent overruns.

Model 18802 Anemometer Drive provides a convenient and accurate way to rotate an anemometer shaft at 
a known rate. The motor may be set to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise at any rate between 200 and 
15,000 RPM in 100 RPM increments. The LCD display is referenced to an accurate and stable quartz timebase. 
For completely portable operation, the unit can be operated on internal batteries. For extended operation, an 
AC wall adapter is included.
Model 18811 Anemometer Drive is identical to Model 18802 except the drive motor incorporates a 
gear reducer for operation in the range of 20 to 990 RPM in 10 RPM increments. The lower range 
is recommended for cup anemometer calibration.
Model 18112 Vane Angle Bench Stand is used for benchtop wind direction calibration of the Wind Monitor 
family of sensors. The mounting post engages the direction orientation notch on the Wind Monitor. An easy to 
read pointer indicates 0 to 360 degrees with 1/2 degree resolution.
Model 18212 Vane Angle Fixture - Tower Mount similar to the Model 18112, the tower mount feature allows use 
on the tower as well as the bench top. The fixture is temporarily placed on the tower between the Wind Monitor 
and its tower mounting. Index keys and notches are engaged to preserve direction reference.
Model 18310 Propeller Torque Disc checks anemometer bearing torque with 0.1 gm/cm resolu-
tion. The disc temporarily replaces the propeller for torque measurement or simple yet accurate pass/fail 
checks. Charts included with the unit relate torque to propeller threshold with limits for acceptable 
bearing performance.
Model 18312 Cup-Wheel Torque Disc checks cup anemometer bearing torque.
Model 18331 Vane Torque Gauge checks vane bearing torque of the Wind Monitor family sensors. Slip the 
fixture over the main housing and make simple yet accurate vane torque measurements. Charts relating vane 
torque to vane threshold provide limits for acceptable bearing performance.
Model 18301 Vane Alignment Rod helps align the vane of a wind sensor to a known direction reference during 
installation. The base of the device has an index key that engages the direction orientation notch in the sensor 
allowing the sensor to be removed without losing wind direction reference.

Query #3:
  Query: Vaisala HMP155 operational temperature range accuracy response characteristics
  Dataset: sensor_knowledge
  Node Sets: temperature_humidity_sensor
  Results: 2
  
  Document Chunks:
    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.

Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.

Query #4:
  Query: Vaisala HMP155 abrupt temperature deviation loss of correlation with humidity maintenance troubleshooting
  Dataset: maintenance_knowledge
  Node Sets: temperature_humidity_sensor
  Results: 2
  
  Document Chunks:
    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.
