Result:
    To troubleshoot low temperature anomalies and humidity issues with the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, follow these steps:
    
    1. **Check Connections**: Ensure the sensor is wired correctly to the analog input channels.
    2. **Verify Power Supply**: Confirm that the red power wire is connected to the 12V or SW12V channel and that the sensor is receiving constant power.
    3. **Measure Output Voltage**: Use a voltmeter to check output voltage for temperature (yellow wire) and humidity (blue wire).
    4. **Inspect the Probe Filter**: If humidity is reported incorrectly (e.g., -9999, NAN, or 0%), consider changing the probe filter as it may be contaminated or clogged.
    5. **Calibration**: Recalibrate the sensor annually to ensure accuracy.
    6. **Clean the Sensor**: Clean the sensor tip and radiation shield to ensure no debris or salt is affecting measurement accuracy.
    
    By performing these checks and maintenance tasks, you can address the low temperature and humidity readings effectively.
    
    The Vaisala HMP155 probe is designed for accurate humidity and temperature measurements in harsh environments. For troubleshooting low temperature anomalies with regards to humidity and solar radiation, ensure the probe is protected from precipitation and direct sunlight by using appropriate radiation shields (DTR503, DTR13, or Stevenson screen). Additionally, check calibration and the condition of the warmed probe feature, as it helps prevent condensation and ensures more reliable readings in high humidity. If issues persist, consider checking the output connections or using the USB connection for diagnostics.

[32mResponse from Worker node 15df9c38-b31d-412c-8623-672abdf50570 (Weather data analysis):[39m

[32mI retrieved satellite‑based weather data for the coordinates (-7.81665, 110.29481) covering 00:00‑01:00 UTC on 2024‑08‑19 (the period that includes the requested 07:40 local time, which is 00:40 UTC). The nearest 15‑minute records are:

- 00:30 UTC (07:30 local): temperature 23.3 °C, relative humidity 81 %, direct solar radiation 140 W/m²
- 00:45 UTC (07:45 local): temperature 23.8 °C, relative humidity 78 %, direct solar radiation 169 W/m²

Interpolating to 00:40 UTC (07:40 local) gives an estimated temperature of **≈23.5 °C**, humidity of **≈79 %**, and solar radiation of **≈155 W/m²**.

**Comparison with the anomalous sensor readings**
- Reported temperature: **0.92 °C** – about **22 °C lower** than the satellite estimate.
- Reported humidity: **49.1 %** – roughly **30 % lower** than the satellite estimate.
- Reported solar radiation: **530.6 W/m²** – more than **3‑times higher** than the satellite estimate.

These discrepancies are far beyond normal sensor‑to‑satellite differences and strongly support the original trend analysis that the temperature sensor (Vaisala HMP155) is malfunctioning. The humidity and radiation values are also inconsistent with the satellite data, suggesting either additional sensor issues or data‑logging errors.

**Operational range & sensor suitability**
- The Vaisala HMP155 temperature range is –40 °C to +50 °C, so 0.92 °C is technically within range, but the deviation from the expected ~23 °C indicates a calibration or hardware fault rather than a range‑limit problem.
- Relative humidity range is 0‑100 % (with typical accuracy ±3 % RH). A reading of 49 % when the environment is ~80 % is outside normal accuracy, again pointing to sensor error.
- Direct solar radiation sensors (e.g., pyranometers) typically measure 0‑1200 W/m². The reported 530 W/m² is plausible for a sunny morning, but the satellite‑derived value (~155 W/m²) suggests the station was under partly cloudy conditions; the large mismatch implies a possible mis‑alignment, shading, or calibration issue.

**Possible troubleshooting steps**
1. **Inspect the temperature sensor housing** for moisture ingress, corrosion, or physical damage.
2. **Check power and data‑logger connections** for the temperature, humidity, and radiation sensors.
3. **Perform an on‑site calibration check** using a portable reference thermometer and hygrometer.
4. **Compare recent sensor logs** to identify when the divergence began; a sudden step change often indicates hardware failure.
5. **Clean the solar radiation sensor’s dome** to remove dust or debris that can cause over‑reading.
6. **Run a self‑diagnostic** (if supported) on the Vaisala HMP155 to retrieve error codes.

**Recommendations**
- Replace or service the temperature sensor immediately; continue using the humidity and radiation sensors only after verification against a calibrated reference.
- Until the temperature sensor is fixed, rely on satellite or nearby official weather stations for temperature data in any operational decisions.
- Schedule regular preventive maintenance (quarterly visual inspection, annual calibration) for all AWS components to avoid similar faults.
- Document the fault and corrective actions in the station’s maintenance log and update the anomaly detection thresholds to flag such large deviations promptly.

**Overall assessment**: The satellite‑derived weather conditions (≈23.5 °C, 79 % RH, 155 W/m²) are consistent with a typical early‑morning tropical climate in Yogyakarta. The sensor‑reported temperature of 0.92 °C, together with the mismatched humidity and radiation values, clearly indicates a sensor malfunction rather than a genuine meteorological event. Prompt sensor replacement/repair and verification against reference instruments are advised.[39m

[32mThe Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor has an operating temperature range of -80 °C to +60 °C. Its accuracy is ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × T) °C for temperatures between -80 °C and +20 °C, and ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × T) °C for temperatures between +20 °C and +60 °C. The sensor’s sensitivity is defined by its output class tolerances, which are sufficient for typical meteorological measurements. A reading of 0.92 °C falls well within the -80 °C to +60 °C operating range and is within the accuracy limits for that temperature (approximately ±0.23 °C), so the reading is within expected limits.[39m

[32mTroubleshooting steps for a Vaisala HMP155 sensor showing low temperature while humidity and solar radiation are normal: 1) Verify correct wiring and power supply (12 V to red wire). 2) Measure the temperature output voltage on the yellow wire; a voltage far below the expected range indicates a sensor fault. 3) Check the humidity output (blue wire) to confirm it matches the normal humidity reading, confirming the humidity circuit is functional. 4) Inspect and clean the probe tip and radiation shield; debris or water on the sensor can cause erroneous temperature readings. 5) Examine the probe filter; replace it if clogged, as a blocked filter can affect temperature compensation. 6) Perform a calibration check or recalibrate the sensor; an out‑of‑date calibration can produce low temperature offsets. 7) Ensure the warmed‑probe feature is operating correctly, as a failure can lead to low temperature bias in humid conditions. 8) Use a voltmeter or the USB diagnostic interface to read raw sensor values; if the temperature voltage is abnormal while humidity voltage is normal, the temperature sensing element is likely defective and the sensor should be repaired or replaced.[39m

[32mAt the timestamp 2024-08-19T07:40 (local time, 00:40 UTC), satellite‑derived reference values are approximately 23.5 °C temperature, 79 % relative humidity, and 155 W/m² direct solar radiation. The AWS reported 0.92 °C, 49.1 % RH, and 530.6 W/m². Both humidity (≈30 % lower than expected) and solar radiation (≈3 × higher than expected) deviate far beyond normal sensor tolerances, indicating that they are also anomalous. The simultaneous anomalies across temperature, humidity, and radiation suggest a common underlying fault – such as a power‑supply or data‑logger issue, wiring/connectivity problems, or damage to the sensor housing that affects multiple sensors. A mis‑aligned or dirty pyranometer dome could explain the radiation over‑reading, while moisture ingress or sensor drift could bias temperature and humidity together. In summary, humidity and solar radiation show clear anomalies at the same timestamp, likely linked to a shared hardware or data‑logging problem rather than independent weather phenomena.[39m

[32m**Assessment Summary**
- **Observed weather (satellite, 07:40 local / 00:40 UTC)**: temperature ≈ 23.5 °C, relative humidity ≈ 79 %, direct solar radiation ≈ 155 W/m². These values are typical for an early‑morning tropical morning in Yogyakarta.
- **Sensor readings**: temperature 0.92 °C, humidity 49.1 %, solar radiation 530.6 W/m². The temperature is ~22 °C lower than expected, humidity ~30 % lower, and radiation >3× higher. The discrepancies far exceed normal sensor‑to‑satellite differences, confirming a sensor fault rather than a real meteorological event.

**Sensor Specification Check**
- **Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor**: operating range –80 °C to +60 °C, accuracy ±0.23 °C around 0 °C. The 0.92 °C reading is within the technical range but inconsistent with the ambient temperature, indicating calibration or hardware failure.
- **Relative humidity sensor (part of HMP155)**: range 0‑100 % with ±3 % accuracy. A 49 % reading when ambient is ~79 % is outside normal error bounds, suggesting the humidity circuit is also compromised.
- **Solar radiation sensor**: typical range 0‑1200 W/m². The reported 530 W/m² is plausible for a sunny morning, but satellite data (~155 W/m²) indicates partly cloudy conditions, pointing to possible mis‑alignment, shading, or calibration error.

**Troubleshooting Findings (from manufacturer guidance)**
1. Verify wiring and 12 V power to the temperature probe (red wire).  
2. Measure the temperature output voltage (yellow wire); a voltage far below the expected range confirms a sensor fault.  
3. Confirm humidity output (blue wire) matches the humidity reading – normal humidity voltage suggests the humidity circuit is still functional.  
4. Inspect and clean the probe tip, radiation shield, and dome; debris or water can bias temperature low and radiation high.  
5. Check the probe filter; replace if clogged.  
6. Test the warmed‑probe feature; failure can cause low temperature bias in humid conditions.  
7. Perform a calibration check or recalibrate the sensor; an outdated calibration can produce large offsets.  
8. Use the USB diagnostic interface or self‑diagnostic mode to read raw sensor values; abnormal temperature voltage with normal humidity voltage points to a defective temperature element.

**Actionable Recommendations**
- **Immediate**: Replace the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor (or the entire unit) as the temperature output is clearly erroneous. Verify the humidity and radiation sensors after the temperature fix; if they remain inconsistent, clean/realign the pyranometer dome and recalibrate the humidity sensor.
- **Short‑term data handling**: Until the temperature sensor is repaired, rely on satellite data or a nearby official AWS for temperature information in operational decisions. Flag temperature data from this station as unreliable in the data pipeline.
- **Verification**: After replacement, perform on‑site calibration using a portable, calibrated thermometer and hygrometer. Compare at least 24 h of logged data against satellite/nearby stations to confirm alignment.
- **Preventive maintenance**: Implement quarterly visual inspections (probe tip, shield, wiring), annual calibration checks, and a bi‑annual cleaning of the solar radiation dome. Document all inspections and any corrective actions in the station’s maintenance log.
- **Threshold tuning**: Adjust the anomaly detection thresholds to trigger alerts when temperature deviates >5 °C from the 20‑interval mean, and when humidity or radiation deviate >20 % from expected values, to catch similar faults earlier.

**Overall Conclusion**: The large mismatch between satellite‑derived weather conditions and the station’s sensor outputs, combined with the sensor‑specific troubleshooting guidance, confirms a malfunction of the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor (and likely the humidity circuit). Prompt replacement, verification, and enhanced maintenance routines are required to restore reliable observations at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA.[39m

--- Subtask a5f8602c-6125-4af7-af44-44c380f998da.1 Result ---
I retrieved satellite‑based weather data for the coordinates (-7.81665, 110.29481) covering 00:00‑01:00 UTC on 2024‑08‑19 (the period that includes the requested 07:40 local time, which is 00:40 UTC). The nearest 15‑minute records are:

**Overall assessment**: The satellite‑derived weather conditions (≈23.5 °C, 79 % RH, 155 W/m²) are consistent with a typical early‑morning tropical climate in Yogyakarta. The sensor‑reported temperature of 0.92 °C, together with the mismatched humidity and radiation values, clearly indicates a sensor malfunction rather than a genuine meteorological event. Prompt sensor replacement/repair and verification against reference instruments are advised.

The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor has an operating temperature range of -80 °C to +60 °C. Its accuracy is ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × T) °C for temperatures between -80 °C and +20 °C, and ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × T) °C for temperatures between +20 °C and +60 °C. The sensor’s sensitivity is defined by its output class tolerances, which are sufficient for typical meteorological measurements. A reading of 0.92 °C falls well within the -80 °C to +60 °C operating range and is within the accuracy limits for that temperature (approximately ±0.23 °C), so the reading is within expected limits.

Troubleshooting steps for a Vaisala HMP155 sensor showing low temperature while humidity and solar radiation are normal: 1) Verify correct wiring and power supply (12 V to red wire). 2) Measure the temperature output voltage on the yellow wire; a voltage far below the expected range indicates a sensor fault. 3) Check the humidity output (blue wire) to confirm it matches the normal humidity reading, confirming the humidity circuit is functional. 4) Inspect and clean the probe tip and radiation shield; debris or water on the sensor can cause erroneous temperature readings. 5) Examine the probe filter; replace it if clogged, as a blocked filter can affect temperature compensation. 6) Perform a calibration check or recalibrate the sensor; an out‑of‑date calibration can produce low temperature offsets. 7) Ensure the warmed‑probe feature is operating correctly, as a failure can lead to low temperature bias in humid conditions. 8) Use a voltmeter or the USB diagnostic interface to read raw sensor values; if the temperature voltage is abnormal while humidity voltage is normal, the temperature sensing element is likely defective and the sensor should be repaired or replaced.

**Assessment Summary**
- **Observed weather (satellite, 07:40 local / 00:40 UTC)**: temperature ≈ 23.5 °C, relative humidity ≈ 79 %, direct solar radiation ≈ 155 W/m². These values are typical for an early‑morning tropical morning in Yogyakarta.
- **Sensor readings**: temperature 0.92 °C, humidity 49.1 %, solar radiation 530.6 W/m². The temperature is ~22 °C lower than expected, humidity ~30 % lower, and radiation >3× higher. The discrepancies far exceed normal sensor‑to‑satellite differences, confirming a sensor fault rather than a real meteorological event.

**Sensor Specification Check**
- **Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor**: operating range –80 °C to +60 °C, accuracy ±0.23 °C around 0 °C. The 0.92 °C reading is within the technical range but inconsistent with the ambient temperature, indicating calibration or hardware failure.
- **Relative humidity sensor (part of HMP155)**: range 0‑100 % with ±3 % accuracy. A 49 % reading when ambient is ~79 % is outside normal error bounds, suggesting the humidity circuit is also compromised.
- **Solar radiation sensor**: typical range 0‑1200 W/m². The reported 530 W/m² is plausible for a sunny morning, but satellite data (~155 W/m²) indicates partly cloudy conditions, pointing to possible mis‑alignment, shading, or calibration error.

**Troubleshooting Findings (from manufacturer guidance)**
1. Verify wiring and 12 V power to the temperature probe (red wire).  
2. Measure the temperature output voltage (yellow wire); a voltage far below the expected range confirms a sensor fault.  
3. Confirm humidity output (blue wire) matches the humidity reading – normal humidity voltage suggests the humidity circuit is still functional.  
4. Inspect and clean the probe tip, radiation shield, and dome; debris or water can bias temperature low and radiation high.  
5. Check the probe filter; replace if clogged.  
6. Test the warmed‑probe feature; failure can cause low temperature bias in humid conditions.  
7. Perform a calibration check or recalibrate the sensor; an outdated calibration can produce large offsets.  
8. Use the USB diagnostic interface or self‑diagnostic mode to read raw sensor values; abnormal temperature voltage with normal humidity voltage points to a defective temperature element.

**Actionable Recommendations**
- **Immediate**: Replace the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor (or the entire unit) as the temperature output is clearly erroneous. Verify the humidity and radiation sensors after the temperature fix; if they remain inconsistent, clean/realign the pyranometer dome and recalibrate the humidity sensor.
- **Short‑term data handling**: Until the temperature sensor is repaired, rely on satellite data or a nearby official AWS for temperature information in operational decisions. Flag temperature data from this station as unreliable in the data pipeline.
- **Verification**: After replacement, perform on‑site calibration using a portable, calibrated thermometer and hygrometer. Compare at least 24 h of logged data against satellite/nearby stations to confirm alignment.
- **Preventive maintenance**: Implement quarterly visual inspections (probe tip, shield, wiring), annual calibration checks, and a bi‑annual cleaning of the solar radiation dome. Document all inspections and any corrective actions in the station’s maintenance log.
- **Threshold tuning**: Adjust the anomaly detection thresholds to trigger alerts when temperature deviates >5 °C from the 20‑interval mean, and when humidity or radiation deviate >20 % from expected values, to catch similar faults earlier.

**Overall Conclusion**: The large mismatch between satellite‑derived weather conditions and the station’s sensor outputs, combined with the sensor‑specific troubleshooting guidance, confirms a malfunction of the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor (and likely the humidity circuit). Prompt replacement, verification, and enhanced maintenance routines are required to restore reliable observations at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA.

At the timestamp 2024-08-19T07:40 (local time, 00:40 UTC), satellite‑derived reference values are approximately 23.5 °C temperature, 79 % relative humidity, and 155 W/m² direct solar radiation. The AWS reported 0.92 °C, 49.1 % RH, and 530.6 W/m². Both humidity (≈30 % lower than expected) and solar radiation (≈3 × higher than expected) deviate far beyond normal sensor tolerances, indicating that they are also anomalous. The simultaneous anomalies across temperature, humidity, and radiation suggest a common underlying fault – such as a power‑supply or data‑logger issue, wiring/connectivity problems, or damage to the sensor housing that affects multiple sensors. A mis‑aligned or dirty pyranometer dome could explain the radiation over‑reading, while moisture ingress or sensor drift could bias temperature and humidity together. In summary, humidity and solar radiation show clear anomalies at the same timestamp, likely linked to a shared hardware or data‑logging problem rather than independent weather phenomena.

    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.

recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
Vaisala HUMICAPâ Humidity and Temperature Probe
