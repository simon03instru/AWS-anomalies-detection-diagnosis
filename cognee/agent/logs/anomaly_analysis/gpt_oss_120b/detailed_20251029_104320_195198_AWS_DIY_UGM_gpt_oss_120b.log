    To troubleshoot abrupt humidity drop failures in the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor, follow these steps:
    
    1. **Check Wiring:** Ensure the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels according to the measurement instructions.
    2. **Verify Power Supply:** Make sure the red power wire is correctly connected to a 12V or SW12V channel. Use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for temperature and relative humidity.
    3. **Inspect the Probe and Filter:** Examine the probe for secure mounting, check the radiation shield for intactness, and clean or replace the filter if it is contaminated.
    4. **Keep Sensor Clean:** Regularly clean the sensor and shield to prevent debris or salt buildup that can affect readings.
    5. **Check for Contamination:** If measurements are inaccurate, consider contamination of the sensor element; clean it with distilled water if needed.
    6. **Recalibrate Annually:** It’s recommended to recalibrate the HMP155 annually to maintain accuracy.
    
    To troubleshoot abrupt humidity drop failures in the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor, consider the following potential failure modes based on the context of the device:
    
    1. **Warmed Probe Issues:** If the warmed probe fails to function correctly, condensation may form on the sensor, leading to inaccurate humidity readings.
    
    2. **Environmental Factors:** High humidity environments (fog, mist, rain) can affect measurements. Ensure the sensor is protected from these conditions, possibly by verifying the sintered Teflon filter and ensuring that no moisture is entering the probe.
    
    3. **Calibration Problems:** Check if the probe is calibrated correctly, as a significant calibration drift can lead to abrupt changes in readings.
    
    4. **Electrical Connection Issues:** Inspect the USB and electrical connections for any faults or interruptions that might affect the sensor's performance.
    
    5. **Chemical Purge Sensitivity:** If using the chemical purge option, make sure it's functioning properly, as chemicals can impact the sensor's accuracy.
    
    6. **Sensor Damage:** Physically inspect the sensor for any damage or wear that could lead to failure in humidity measurement.
    
    By addressing these factors, you can help diagnose and potentially rectify the abrupt humidity drop issue.

[32mI retrieved the satellite‑based weather data for the coordinates (-7.768469, 110.38192) covering the period 19:00 UTC to 21:00 UTC on 2024‑08‑15. The 15‑minute record that brackets the requested time (20:10 UTC) is the 20:00 UTC entry. At that moment the observed conditions were:
- Relative humidity: **86 %**
- Temperature: **20.5 °C**
- Direct solar radiation: **0.0 W m⁻²** (nighttime, as expected)
- Precipitation: **0.0 mm**

Compared with the anomalous sensor reading (30 % humidity, 21.9 °C temperature, zero solar radiation), the satellite data show a much higher humidity (86 % vs 30 %) and a slightly lower temperature (20.5 °C vs 21.9 °C). The solar radiation and precipitation values match the sensor’s zero readings, which is consistent with night conditions. The large humidity discrepancy strongly suggests a sensor malfunction rather than a true atmospheric event.

**Assessment**: The satellite observations do not support the reported sudden drop to 30 % humidity. The temperature is within a plausible range but the humidity is far off. No precipitation was detected, and solar radiation was correctly zero for night.

**Recommendation**: Inspect or replace the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor, recalibrate if possible, and verify wiring/power. Continue monitoring with the satellite reference as a baseline.

[32mVaisala HMP155 humidity sensor specifications:
- Operational humidity range: 0 % to 100 % RH (full range).
- Accuracy: ±0.6 % RH for 0‑40 % RH; ±1.0 % RH for 40‑95 % RH; at +15 °C‑+25 °C, ±1 % RH for 0‑90 % RH and ±1.7 % RH for 90‑100 % RH.
- Response time: 63 % of step change in ~20 s, 90 % of step change in ~60 s.
- Recommended operating conditions: Operating temperature –80 °C to +60 °C, storage temperature –80 °C to +60 °C, IP66 enclosure, and clean environment (regular monthly inspection of probe filter and radiation shield, annual recalibration).
Assessment of the reported sudden drop to 30 % RH:
- The 30 % value lies well within the sensor’s operational humidity range (0‑100 % RH) and within the accuracy band (±0.6 % RH for this range).
- The response time (20‑60 s) means the sensor can capture rapid changes, so a sudden drop to 30 % RH is technically possible within its performance envelope.
- However, the anomaly description notes that temperature remained unchanged (≈21.9 °C) and solar radiation was zero (nighttime). Such a sharp humidity decline without a corresponding temperature change or solar heating is atypical for natural atmospheric behavior, suggesting the sensor may have experienced a transient fault (e.g., probe contamination, electrical glitch) rather than a true atmospheric event. The sensor’s specifications do not indicate any inherent coupling that would prevent a rapid humidity change at constant temperature, but the lack of corroborating environmental cues points toward a likely sensor malfunction.[39m

[32m**Known failure modes causing abrupt humidity drops in the Vaisala HMP155**
1. Warmed‑probe malfunction – condensation on the probe leads to low readings.
2. Probe or filter contamination (dust, salt, moisture) affecting the sensor element.
3. Calibration drift or loss of calibration.
4. Incorrect or loose wiring/power supply to the sensor.
5. Electrical connection faults (USB or analog input issues).
6. Chemical purge malfunction (if purge is used).
7. Physical damage or wear of the sensor housing or probe.
8. Environmental exposure (fog, mist, rain) entering the sensor cavity.

**Step‑by‑step troubleshooting procedure**
1. **Check wiring** – Verify the sensor is connected to the correct analog input channels and that the red power wire is attached to a 12 V or SW12V channel.
2. **Verify power supply** – Measure the voltage on the temperature and humidity outputs with a voltmeter to confirm proper supply.
3. **Inspect probe and filter** – Ensure the probe is securely mounted, the radiation shield is intact, and the sintered Teflon filter is clean and not clogged.
4. **Clean the sensor** – Remove debris or salt buildup from the probe and shield; clean the probe with distilled water if contamination is suspected.
5. **Check warmed‑probe operation** – Confirm the heated element is functioning; a failed heated probe can cause condensation and low humidity readings.
6. **Assess calibration** – Perform a calibration check; recalibrate the HMP155 if drift is detected (annual recalibration is recommended).
7. **Examine electrical connections** – Inspect USB and other electrical contacts for loose or corroded connections.
8. **Verify chemical purge (if used)** – Ensure the purge system is operating correctly; a malfunction can affect humidity measurements.
9. **Look for physical damage** – Inspect the sensor housing and probe for cracks or wear that could impair performance.

**Immediate maintenance actions**
- Clean or replace the probe filter if contamination is observed.
- Re‑secure any loose wiring and correct power supply connections.
- Recalibrate the sensor if calibration drift is identified.
- Replace the sensor if physical damage or persistent warmed‑probe failure is found.
- Ensure proper shielding from rain, fog, or mist to prevent environmental ingress.
- If a chemical purge is installed, service or replace the purge unit as needed.

These actions address the most common causes of sudden humidity drops reported for the Vaisala HMP155 and provide a clear path for restoring accurate humidity measurements at the AWS station.[39m

[32m**Comprehensive Assessment of the Humidity Anomaly (2024‑08‑15T20:10:00 UTC)**

1. **Observed vs. Expected Conditions**
   - Satellite‑derived weather at the station (20:00 UTC record):
     - Relative humidity: **86 %**
     - Temperature: **20.5 °C**
     - Direct solar radiation: **0 W m⁻²** (night)
     - Precipitation: **0 mm**
   - Sensor‑reported values (Vaisala HMP155):
     - Relative humidity: **30 %** (anomalous drop)
     - Temperature: **21.9 °C** (within normal range)
     - Solar radiation & precipitation: correctly reported as zero.
   - Typical climatology for the site at this hour: ~76 % RH (±2 %).
   - **Result:** The humidity reading is **~56 percentage points lower** than the satellite reference and far outside normal variability, while temperature and radiation are consistent.

2. **Sensor Specification Context**
   - Operational range: 0‑100 % RH (covers 30 %).
   - Accuracy: ±0.6 % RH for 0‑40 % RH – the sensor could reliably read 30 % ± 0.6 % if the atmosphere truly were that dry.
   - Response time: 20‑60 s – capable of capturing rapid changes.
   - No specification prevents a sudden drop at constant temperature, but **natural atmospheric physics at night (no solar heating, no precipitation) makes a rapid humidity plunge to 30 % highly improbable**.

3. **Known Failure Modes (Vaisala HMP155)**
   - Warmed‑probe malfunction → condensation on probe → low RH output.
   - Probe/filter contamination (dust, salt, moisture) → biased low readings.
   - Calibration drift or loss of calibration.
   - Loose or incorrect wiring / power supply issues.
   - Electrical connection faults (USB/analog input).
   - Physical damage or ingress of water/fog.

4. **Likelihood Assessment**
   - **Sensor fault:** ~90 % probability. The magnitude of the discrepancy, the lack of supporting environmental cues, and the presence of documented failure modes strongly point to a sensor issue.
   - **Genuine atmospheric event:** ~10 % probability. Only a very localized, transient micro‑climate (e.g., sudden dry air advection) could produce such a drop, but satellite data and climatology do not support this.

5. **Potential Correlations with Other Parameters**
   - Temperature remained stable (≈22 °C) – no warming that would drive evaporation.
   - Solar radiation was zero – no radiative drying.
   - No precipitation – no removal of moisture.
   - The absence of any concurrent change in these parameters further isolates the humidity sensor as the outlier.

6. **Actionable Recommendations for the Station Operator**
   1. **Immediate Inspection**
      - Verify all wiring connections to the HMP155 (power and signal lines). Tighten any loose terminals.
      - Measure supply voltage at the sensor to confirm proper power (12 V nominal).
   2. **Probe & Filter Check**
      - Visually inspect the probe and sintered Teflon filter for dust, salt, or moisture buildup.
      - Clean the probe with distilled water and a soft brush if contamination is observed; replace the filter if clogged.
   3. **Warmed‑Probe Function**
      - Confirm the heated element is operational (check heating current). A failed heated probe often yields low RH readings at night.
   4. **Calibration Verification**
      - Perform an on‑site calibration check using a calibrated hygrometer or a reference chamber.
      - If drift is detected, schedule a professional recalibration (annual recommended).
   5. **Physical Condition**
      - Inspect the sensor housing for cracks, water ingress, or damage to the radiation shield.
   6. **Replace if Necessary**
      - If wiring, probe, heating, and calibration are all verified but the anomaly persists, replace the HMP155 unit.
   7. **Monitoring & Documentation**
      - Continue logging humidity and compare future readings against satellite reference (e.g., ECMWF or similar) for the next 24‑48 h to confirm resolution.
      - Document the fault, corrective actions taken, and any post‑maintenance performance metrics.

**Conclusion:** The weight of evidence (large humidity deviation, consistent temperature/radiation, known sensor failure modes) indicates a **high‑confidence sensor malfunction** rather than a true atmospheric event. Following the step‑by‑step troubleshooting and maintenance actions above should restore reliable humidity measurements at AWS DIY UGM.[39m

FINAL OUTPUT - SYNTHESIZED RESULT
================================================================================
--- Subtask 30745d8b-b4ad-4693-9fc9-b5c59a04b9dd.1 Result ---
I retrieved the satellite‑based weather data for the coordinates (-7.768469, 110.38192) covering the period 19:00 UTC to 21:00 UTC on 2024‑08‑15. The 15‑minute record that brackets the requested time (20:10 UTC) is the 20:00 UTC entry. At that moment the observed conditions were:
- Relative humidity: **86 %**
- Temperature: **20.5 °C**
- Direct solar radiation: **0.0 W m⁻²** (nighttime, as expected)
- Precipitation: **0.0 mm**

Compared with the anomalous sensor reading (30 % humidity, 21.9 °C temperature, zero solar radiation), the satellite data show a much higher humidity (86 % vs 30 %) and a slightly lower temperature (20.5 °C vs 21.9 °C). The solar radiation and precipitation values match the sensor’s zero readings, which is consistent with night conditions. The large humidity discrepancy strongly suggests a sensor malfunction rather than a true atmospheric event.

**Assessment**: The satellite observations do not support the reported sudden drop to 30 % humidity. The temperature is within a plausible range but the humidity is far off. No precipitation was detected, and solar radiation was correctly zero for night.

**Recommendation**: Inspect or replace the Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor, recalibrate if possible, and verify wiring/power. Continue monitoring with the satellite reference as a baseline.

Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor specifications:
- Operational humidity range: 0 % to 100 % RH (full range).
- Accuracy: ±0.6 % RH for 0‑40 % RH; ±1.0 % RH for 40‑95 % RH; at +15 °C‑+25 °C, ±1 % RH for 0‑90 % RH and ±1.7 % RH for 90‑100 % RH.
- Response time: 63 % of step change in ~20 s, 90 % of step change in ~60 s.
- Recommended operating conditions: Operating temperature –80 °C to +60 °C, storage temperature –80 °C to +60 °C, IP66 enclosure, and clean environment (regular monthly inspection of probe filter and radiation shield, annual recalibration).
Assessment of the reported sudden drop to 30 % RH:
- The 30 % value lies well within the sensor’s operational humidity range (0‑100 % RH) and within the accuracy band (±0.6 % RH for this range).
- The response time (20‑60 s) means the sensor can capture rapid changes, so a sudden drop to 30 % RH is technically possible within its performance envelope.
- However, the anomaly description notes that temperature remained unchanged (≈21.9 °C) and solar radiation was zero (nighttime). Such a sharp humidity decline without a corresponding temperature change or solar heating is atypical for natural atmospheric behavior, suggesting the sensor may have experienced a transient fault (e.g., probe contamination, electrical glitch) rather than a true atmospheric event. The sensor’s specifications do not indicate any inherent coupling that would prevent a rapid humidity change at constant temperature, but the lack of corroborating environmental cues points toward a likely sensor malfunction.

**Known failure modes causing abrupt humidity drops in the Vaisala HMP155**
1. Warmed‑probe malfunction – condensation on the probe leads to low readings.
2. Probe or filter contamination (dust, salt, moisture) affecting the sensor element.
3. Calibration drift or loss of calibration.
4. Incorrect or loose wiring/power supply to the sensor.
5. Electrical connection faults (USB or analog input issues).
6. Chemical purge malfunction (if purge is used).
7. Physical damage or wear of the sensor housing or probe.
8. Environmental exposure (fog, mist, rain) entering the sensor cavity.

**Step‑by‑step troubleshooting procedure**
1. **Check wiring** – Verify the sensor is connected to the correct analog input channels and that the red power wire is attached to a 12 V or SW12V channel.
2. **Verify power supply** – Measure the voltage on the temperature and humidity outputs with a voltmeter to confirm proper supply.
3. **Inspect probe and filter** – Ensure the probe is securely mounted, the radiation shield is intact, and the sintered Teflon filter is clean and not clogged.
4. **Clean the sensor** – Remove debris or salt buildup from the probe and shield; clean the probe with distilled water if contamination is suspected.
5. **Check warmed‑probe operation** – Confirm the heated element is functioning; a failed heated probe can cause condensation and low humidity readings.
6. **Assess calibration** – Perform a calibration check; recalibrate the HMP155 if drift is detected (annual recalibration is recommended).
7. **Examine electrical connections** – Inspect USB and other electrical contacts for loose or corroded connections.
8. **Verify chemical purge (if used)** – Ensure the purge system is operating correctly; a malfunction can affect humidity measurements.
9. **Look for physical damage** – Inspect the sensor housing and probe for cracks or wear that could impair performance.

**Immediate maintenance actions**
- Clean or replace the probe filter if contamination is observed.
- Re‑secure any loose wiring and correct power supply connections.
- Recalibrate the sensor if calibration drift is identified.
- Replace the sensor if physical damage or persistent warmed‑probe failure is found.
- Ensure proper shielding from rain, fog, or mist to prevent environmental ingress.
- If a chemical purge is installed, service or replace the purge unit as needed.

These actions address the most common causes of sudden humidity drops reported for the Vaisala HMP155 and provide a clear path for restoring accurate humidity measurements at the AWS station.

**Comprehensive Assessment of the Humidity Anomaly (2024‑08‑15T20:10:00 UTC)**

1. **Observed vs. Expected Conditions**
   - Satellite‑derived weather at the station (20:00 UTC record):
     - Relative humidity: **86 %**
     - Temperature: **20.5 °C**
     - Direct solar radiation: **0 W m⁻²** (night)
     - Precipitation: **0 mm**
   - Sensor‑reported values (Vaisala HMP155):
     - Relative humidity: **30 %** (anomalous drop)
     - Temperature: **21.9 °C** (within normal range)
     - Solar radiation & precipitation: correctly reported as zero.
   - Typical climatology for the site at this hour: ~76 % RH (±2 %).
   - **Result:** The humidity reading is **~56 percentage points lower** than the satellite reference and far outside normal variability, while temperature and radiation are consistent.

2. **Sensor Specification Context**
   - Operational range: 0‑100 % RH (covers 30 %).
   - Accuracy: ±0.6 % RH for 0‑40 % RH – the sensor could reliably read 30 % ± 0.6 % if the atmosphere truly were that dry.
   - Response time: 20‑60 s – capable of capturing rapid changes.
   - No specification prevents a sudden drop at constant temperature, but **natural atmospheric physics at night (no solar heating, no precipitation) makes a rapid humidity plunge to 30 % highly improbable**.

3. **Known Failure Modes (Vaisala HMP155)**
   - Warmed‑probe malfunction → condensation on probe → low RH output.
   - Probe/filter contamination (dust, salt, moisture) → biased low readings.
   - Calibration drift or loss of calibration.
   - Loose or incorrect wiring / power supply issues.
   - Electrical connection faults (USB/analog input).
   - Physical damage or ingress of water/fog.

4. **Likelihood Assessment**
   - **Sensor fault:** ~90 % probability. The magnitude of the discrepancy, the lack of supporting environmental cues, and the presence of documented failure modes strongly point to a sensor issue.
   - **Genuine atmospheric event:** ~10 % probability. Only a very localized, transient micro‑climate (e.g., sudden dry air advection) could produce such a drop, but satellite data and climatology do not support this.

5. **Potential Correlations with Other Parameters**
   - Temperature remained stable (≈22 °C) – no warming that would drive evaporation.
   - Solar radiation was zero – no radiative drying.
   - No precipitation – no removal of moisture.
   - The absence of any concurrent change in these parameters further isolates the humidity sensor as the outlier.

6. **Actionable Recommendations for the Station Operator**
   1. **Immediate Inspection**
      - Verify all wiring connections to the HMP155 (power and signal lines). Tighten any loose terminals.
      - Measure supply voltage at the sensor to confirm proper power (12 V nominal).
   2. **Probe & Filter Check**
      - Visually inspect the probe and sintered Teflon filter for dust, salt, or moisture buildup.
      - Clean the probe with distilled water and a soft brush if contamination is observed; replace the filter if clogged.
   3. **Warmed‑Probe Function**
      - Confirm the heated element is operational (check heating current). A failed heated probe often yields low RH readings at night.
   4. **Calibration Verification**
      - Perform an on‑site calibration check using a calibrated hygrometer or a reference chamber.
      - If drift is detected, schedule a professional recalibration (annual recommended).
   5. **Physical Condition**
      - Inspect the sensor housing for cracks, water ingress, or damage to the radiation shield.
   6. **Replace if Necessary**
      - If wiring, probe, heating, and calibration are all verified but the anomaly persists, replace the HMP155 unit.
   7. **Monitoring & Documentation**
      - Continue logging humidity and compare future readings against satellite reference (e.g., ECMWF or similar) for the next 24‑48 h to confirm resolution.
      - Document the fault, corrective actions taken, and any post‑maintenance performance metrics.

**Conclusion:** The weight of evidence (large humidity deviation, consistent temperature/radiation, known sensor failure modes) indicates a **high‑confidence sensor malfunction** rather than a true atmospheric event. Following the step‑by‑step troubleshooting and maintenance actions above should restore reliable humidity measurements at AWS DIY UGM.

    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as

humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address

Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
Vaisala HUMICAPâ Humidity and Temperature Probe
HMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature
measurement. It is designed especially for demanding
outdoor applications.

If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed
every yea

Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.

HMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature
measurement. It is designed especially for demanding
outdoor applications.
