    To troubleshoot false high rainfall spikes in the Hyquest TB4 tipping bucket rain gauge, follow these steps: 1. Ensure the sensor is properly wired to the designated terminals and calibrate settings (PulseCount() parameters) are correct for your data logger. 2. Check for any debris or sediment in the collection funnel and tipping bucket assembly that could affect measurements. 3. Clean and maintain the catch filter, siphon, and interior of the bucket regularly. 4. Perform a calibration check once a year. If problems persist, consult Hyquest Solutions for assistance.
    
    To troubleshoot false high rainfall spikes in the HyQuest TB4 tipping bucket rain gauge, consider the following steps:
    
    1. **Maintenance Check**: Ensure the collector catch area is free from debris like leaves or bird droppings which could block the funnel and cause erroneous readings. Use the finger filter for easier access during field service.
    2. **Calibration**: Run field calibrations using the Portable Field Calibration Device (FCD) to ensure the gauge is accurately measuring rainfall. The FCD allows for functional tests without dismantling the gauge.
    3. **Check for Environmental Factors**: Examine whether environmental conditions, such as high winds or nearby structures, might be affecting the readings.
    4. **Inspect the Mechanism**: Examine the tipping bucket mechanism for any mechanical issues that could lead to inaccurate readings or malfunction.
    5. **Data Verification**: Utilize the dual output features of the TB4 to cross-verify data with a second data logger to determine if readings are consistent.

[32mResponse from Worker node 0beb47be-9c57-4399-802e-29ba10ef5cf1 (Weather data analysis):[39m

[32mI retrieved satellite‑based weather data for the coordinates (-7.768469, 110.38192) covering 12:00 UTC to 14:00 UTC on 2024‑08‑15. Yogyakarta is UTC+7, so the event time of 20:00 local corresponds to 13:00 UTC, which is within the fetched interval. At 13:00 UTC the data show:
- Temperature: **23.4 °C** (gradually cooling from 23.9 °C at 12:00 UTC)
- Surface pressure: **995.7 hPa** (slightly rising through the period)
- Relative humidity: **75 %** (increasing modestly)
- Precipitation: **0.0 mm** (no rain recorded for the entire 2‑hour window)

The reported sensor reading of **100 mm of rain in a 10‑minute interval** is starkly inconsistent with the satellite‑derived precipitation, which shows no rainfall at all. This discrepancy supports the earlier trend analysis that the rain gauge likely malfunctioned. The other parameters (temperature, pressure, humidity) show normal, smooth variations and do not exhibit any sudden changes that would accompany a heavy rain event. 

**Conclusion:** The satellite data do not corroborate the 100 mm rainfall spike; the sensor reading is almost certainly spurious. No further weather‑related explanation is needed, and the focus should be on sensor inspection, cleaning, and calibration.

**Actionable recommendations:**
1. Visually inspect the HYQUEST TB4 rain gauge for blockage, debris, or mechanical damage.
2. Verify that the tipping‑bucket mechanism moves freely and that the sensor’s firmware is up‑to‑date.
3. Perform a calibration check against a known‑volume water source.
4. If the gauge continues to give unrealistic spikes, consider replacing it or adding a secondary, independent rain sensor for redundancy.
5. Log the next few hours of sensor data alongside satellite observations to confirm normal operation after maintenance.[39m

[32m**Assessment**: The 100 mm rainfall spike recorded at 2024‑08‑15 20:00 local (13:00 UTC) is inconsistent with satellite‑derived weather data, which show 0 mm precipitation, stable temperature (23.4 °C), pressure (995.7 hPa) and humidity (75 %). No concurrent atmospheric changes were observed, confirming the trend analysis that the HYQUEST TB4 rain gauge most likely malfunctioned.

**Most Likely Cause**: A false high‑rainfall spike caused by a mechanical or debris issue in the tipping‑bucket mechanism (e.g., blockage, sticking bucket, or wiring/calibration mismatch). Although the reading (600 mm h⁻¹) is within the sensor’s maximum range (700 mm h⁻¹), the lack of any real rain makes a sensor fault the dominant explanation.

**Actionable Recommendations**:
1. **Visual & Mechanical Inspection** – Check the funnel, catch filter, and interior of the TB4 for leaves, bird droppings, sediment, or other debris; ensure the bucket tips freely.
2. **Clean the Gauge** – Remove any blockage, rinse the funnel, and verify that the siphon is unobstructed.
3. **Verify Wiring & Logger Settings** – Confirm correct terminal connections and that the data logger’s pulse‑count parameters match the TB4 specifications.
4. **Calibration Check** – Perform a field calibration using Hyquest’s Portable Field Calibration Device (or a known‑volume water test) and update firmware if needed.
5. **Cross‑Check Data** – If possible, enable the TB4’s dual‑output to a second logger or install a backup rain sensor for redundancy.
6. **Replace if Necessary** – Should the false spikes persist after cleaning and recalibration, replace the rain gauge.
7. **Post‑Maintenance Monitoring** – Log the next 24 h of rainfall data alongside satellite observations to confirm normal operation.

By following these steps the station can quickly resolve the false spike, restore reliable precipitation measurements, and prevent future data quality issues.[39m

    1. TIPPING BUCKET TAINGAUGE MODEL TB4 HYQUEST Solutions

The only routine maintenance required is cleaning. The following items should be checked
regularly for cleanliness:
 Catch filter
 Syphon (refer diagram 2)
 Interior of bucket
 Top surface of adjusting screws
 Enclosure locking screws - lightly lubricate after cleaning
 All insect screens


ELECTRICAL
Dual reed switches are provided for several reasons:
 Two isolated switches permit the control of two separate circuits; e.g. a local counter
and a telemetry circuit.
 Parallel connection of both switches increases the current carrying capacity of the
contact system if required.
 Parallel switch operation confers a degree of redundancy in locations where data from
the raingauge is critical to flood warning etc.

CALIBRATION
All gauges have been calibrated by Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd, prior to despatch.
The following products and services are available from Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd:
 Field Calibration Device, Model TB320, for routine field check calibrations,
supplied with operating instruction sheet refers to page FCD 110-01.
 Laboratory Calibration Unit, Model TB340, for calibration after servicing in
workshops, supplied with operating manual.
 Recalibration Service at Hyquest Solutions’ factory.
Please contact either Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd or our local distributor for further
information.


Troubleshooting
Symptom: No precipitation measurement
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count
instruction.
2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the
PulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.
Disconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check
of the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket
between the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket
is tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.
Symptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12
1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and
Table 7-3 [p. 10]).

Maintenance
During each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,
debris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.
Verify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket
tip.
Dismantling for cleaning
Regularly check the following items for cleanliness:
l Catch filter
l Siphon

To access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and
lifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).

2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base
Separate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the
siphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.

Disassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):
a. Unscrew nut
b. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body
c. Remove stem from siphon body
d. Unscrew cap
e. Clean all items

Reassembling the rain bucket
1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Push stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Replace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
CAUTION:
Do not over tighten.
Push filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.
5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure
the housing onto the base.

Calibration check
The sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the
adjustment screws have loosened.
Nevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting
upward on the housing.
2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.
3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated
cylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection
funnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).
4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39
times.
5. If the rain gage fails to record the correct number of tips, return the unit to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration (see Assistance at the back of this manual).

General Description
HyQuest Solutions’ TB6 is a non-syphoning 
high-quality tipping bucket rain gauge for 
measuring rainfall and precipitation in urban 
and rural locations. The TB6 is the device of 
choice for accurately measuring low rainfall 
events (0-50 mm/hr with better than +/-1 % 
accuracy), because the water passes through 
the nozzle and enters the bucket directly al-
lowing small rainfall events to be measured. 
The TB6’s tried and proven design ensures 
long-term, accurate and repeatable results. 
It is manufactured from high quality, dura-
ble materials ensuring long term stability in 
the harshest of environments. It consists of 
a robust powder-coated aluminium enclo-
sure, a UV-resistant ASA polymer base, and 
stainless steel fasteners and ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter. 
Easy maintenance
Removal of the outer enclosure and access 
to the tipping bucket mechanism and ﬁ  nger 
ﬁ  lter assembly is made easy with quick 
release fasteners. The ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter can be 
removed easily during a ﬁ  eld service. It 
ensures the collector catch area remains 
unblocked when leaves, bird droppings and 
other debris ﬁ  nd their way into the catch.
The TB6’s base incorporates two water 
outlets at the bottom allowing for wa-
ter collection and data veriﬁ  cation.
Output options
TB6 includes a dual output 24 V DC 
reed switch allowing for output redun-
dancy or the addition of a second data 
logger. The second output could also be 
used for connecting HyQuest Solutions’ 
current meter counter CMCbt paired 
with the free FCD application that allow 
for easy and accurate ﬁ  eld calibration 
even in noisy (urban) environments. The 
reed switch incorporates varistor protection 
against surges that may be induced on long, 
inappropriately shielded signal cables.
Main Features
  Standard 200 mm diameter catch
  Long term stable calibration
  Minimal maintenance required
  Robust design for all environments
  Optional: autonomous real-time rain 
monitoring and reporting system

    1. TIPPING BUCKET TAINGAUGE MODEL TB4 HYQUEST Solutions

The only routine maintenance required is cleaning. The following items should be checked
regularly for cleanliness:
 Catch filter
 Syphon (refer diagram 2)
 Interior of bucket
 Top surface of adjusting screws
 Enclosure locking screws - lightly lubricate after cleaning
 All insect screens


ELECTRICAL
Dual reed switches are provided for several reasons:
 Two isolated switches permit the control of two separate circuits; e.g. a local counter
and a telemetry circuit.
 Parallel connection of both switches increases the current carrying capacity of the
contact system if required.
 Parallel switch operation confers a degree of redundancy in locations where data from
the raingauge is critical to flood warning etc.

CALIBRATION
All gauges have been calibrated by Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd, prior to despatch.
The following products and services are available from Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd:
 Field Calibration Device, Model TB320, for routine field check calibrations,
supplied with operating instruction sheet refers to page FCD 110-01.
 Laboratory Calibration Unit, Model TB340, for calibration after servicing in
workshops, supplied with operating manual.
 Recalibration Service at Hyquest Solutions’ factory.
Please contact either Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd or our local distributor for further
information.


Troubleshooting
Symptom: No precipitation measurement
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count
instruction.
2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the
PulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.
Disconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check
of the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket
between the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket
is tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.
Symptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12
1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and
Table 7-3 [p. 10]).

Maintenance
During each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,
debris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.
Verify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket
tip.
Dismantling for cleaning

l Catch filter
l Siphon
l Interior of bucket
l Top surface of adjusting screws
l Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning
