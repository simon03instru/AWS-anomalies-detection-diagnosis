    To diagnose and correct the constant 100% humidity failure in the Vaisala HMP155, follow these steps:
    
    1. **Check the Wiring:** Ensure the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels and that the red power wire is connected to the correct 12V or SW12V channel.
    
    2. **Voltage Testing:** With the red wire connected to a 12V terminal, use a voltmeter to check the output voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires.
    
    3. **Inspect the Sensor:** If the relative humidity reading is -9999, NaN, -80 °C, or 0%, check the wiring, voltage, and ensure the sensor is configured correctly.
    
    4. **Clean the Sensor:** Contaminants on the sensor or filter can lead to incorrect readings. Clean the probe and filter as needed, replacing the filter if it is contaminated.
    
    5. **Check the Calibration:** Recalibrate the HMP155 annually and verify that it has not drifted, as improper calibration can affect readings.
    
    6. **Look for Physical Damage:** Confirm that the sensor is not physically damaged and is securely mounted.
    
    7. **Replace Components if Necessary:** If issues persist after following the above steps, consider replacing the sensor element or other faulty components.
    
    To diagnose failure modes related to a constant 100% humidity reading in the Vaisala HMP155 probe, follow these steps:
    
    1. **Inspect the Probe**: Check for any visible condensation or dirt on the probe, as a wet or dirty probe can lead to inaccurate measurements.
    2. **Temperature Check**: Ensure the probe's additional temperature sensor is operational. A malfunctioning temperature probe may affect humidity readings.
    3. **Power Supply**: Verify that the power supply is within acceptable range (7-28 V DC) and check connections.
    4. **Calibration Verification**: Check if the probe has been calibrated correctly using a USB cable or with the push buttons. Recalibration may be necessary.
    5. **Environmental Conditions**: Evaluate if the probe is exposed to external factors such as fog, mist, or rain that may cause false readings.

[32mAt the anomaly detection time (2024-08-19T07:40:00Z, which falls between the 07:30 and 07:45 UTC data points), the satellite‑based weather data shows:
- Temperature ≈ 29.0 °C (the 07:30 value) to 28.8 °C (the 07:45 value), roughly 1 °C cooler than the sensor’s reported 30.92 °C.
- Relative humidity ≈ 58 % (07:30) to 59 % (07:45), far below the impossible 100 % reading.
- Precipitation = 0 mm (both timestamps), matching the sensor’s reported 0 mm rainfall.

Comparison summary: The temperature and humidity readings from the weather model are notably lower than the anomalous sensor values, indicating a likely sensor fault for humidity (and possibly temperature). The rainfall report aligns with the model, suggesting no precipitation at that time.

[32mResponse from Worker node 6fee2ca1-9fb5-4b49-bba8-ac50692b3fdd (Sensor specifications):[39m

[32mThe Vaisala HMP155 humidity sensor has an operational humidity range of 0 % RH to 100 % RH, so a 100 % relative humidity reading is within its valid range. Its accuracy is ±1 % RH for 0‑90 % RH (at +15‑+25 °C) and ±1.7 % RH for 90‑100 % RH (at +15‑+25 °C), with temperature‑dependent accuracy elsewhere. The sensor’s response time is about 20 s to reach 63 % of a step change and 60 s to reach 90 % at +20 °C. While the sensor can technically read 100 % RH, the observed exact 100 % reading is physically unlikely and exceeds typical sensor resolution and accuracy limits, indicating a likely sensor fault. The sensor’s sensitivity (±1.7 % RH near saturation) does not support a perfectly stable 100 % reading, aligning with the trend analysis that flags this as an anomaly.[39m

[32mResponse from Worker node 49aac822-31fd-470d-b591-31b94d33ef41 (Maintenance information):[39m

[32mCommon failure modes for a constant 100 % humidity reading on a Vaisala HMP155 sensor include:
• Wiring or connection errors (incorrect power or signal wiring, loose or corroded contacts)
• Power‑supply problems (out‑of‑range voltage, intermittent supply)
• Contaminated or clogged sintered Teflon filter/probe (dust, moisture, condensation)
• Sensor element damage or degradation (physical damage, aging, moisture ingress)
• Calibration drift or failure (out‑of‑date calibration, failed recalibration routine)
• Faulty internal temperature sensor affecting humidity conversion
• External exposure to fog, mist, or rain causing sensor saturation

Recommended diagnostic steps:
1. Verify wiring: confirm red power wire to correct 12 V (or SW12 V) channel, yellow/blue signal wires to analog inputs, and check M12 connector for damage.
2. Measure supply voltage at the sensor terminals (7‑28 V DC acceptable) and signal voltages for temperature and humidity.
3. Visually inspect probe for condensation, dirt, or damage; clean the sintered Teflon filter or replace if clogged.
4. Check the internal temperature sensor reading; abnormal temperature values indicate a temperature‑sensor fault.
5. Review calibration status: perform a recalibration using the USB interface or push‑button routine; verify calibration date.
6. Test sensor output against a known reference (e.g., calibrated hygrometer) to confirm accuracy.
7. If all checks are normal but the reading remains 100 %, replace the sensor element or the entire probe.

Corrective maintenance actions:
• Re‑wire or tighten connections as needed.
• Replace faulty power supply or correct voltage level.
• Clean or replace the sintered filter/probe.
• Recalibrate the sensor according to Vaisala guidelines (annual or after any maintenance).
• Replace damaged sensor element or the whole HMP155 unit if internal faults persist.
• Ensure proper mounting to avoid direct exposure to fog, mist, or rain.

These steps address the identified failure modes and provide a clear path to restore accurate humidity measurements.[39m

[32m**Comprehensive Evaluation of the Relative Humidity Anomaly (2024‑08‑19 07:40 UTC)**

1. **Current Weather Context**
   - Satellite‑based model data at the anomaly time shows temperature ≈ 29 °C (≈ 1 °C lower than the sensor’s 30.92 °C) and relative humidity ≈ 58‑59 % (far below the sensor’s reported 100 %).
   - Precipitation is 0 mm, matching the sensor’s rain report.  The surrounding environment therefore did not support saturation; a true 100 % RH reading is physically implausible.

2. **Sensor Specification Assessment**
   - The Vaisala HMP155 operates from 0‑100 % RH, but its accuracy near saturation is ±1.7 % RH and its resolution cannot reliably hold a perfectly stable 100 % value.
   - The observed exact 100 % reading, combined with a temperature that is higher than expected for that humidity, exceeds the sensor’s realistic performance envelope and aligns with the trend analysis flagging a likely fault.

3. **Troubleshooting & Maintenance Guidance**
   - Common failure modes that produce a constant 100 % reading include:
     * Wiring or power‑supply issues
     * Clogged or contaminated Teflon filter/probe
     * Sensor element degradation or moisture ingress
     * Calibration drift or internal temperature‑sensor fault
   - Recommended diagnostic steps:
     1. Verify correct wiring and secure connections; check for corrosion.
     2. Measure supply voltage (7‑28 V DC) and signal voltages at the sensor terminals.
     3. Inspect the probe for condensation, dust, or damage; clean or replace the sintered filter if needed.
     4. Compare the sensor’s internal temperature reading with a reference; abnormal values suggest a temperature‑sensor fault.
     5. Review calibration status and perform a recalibration using the USB interface or push‑button routine.
     6. Cross‑check output against a calibrated hygrometer; if discrepancy persists, replace the sensor element or the entire HMP155 unit.

4. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - **Immediate Response**: Flag the humidity data as unreliable in the data stream and exclude it from any operational decisions. Notify the station operator of the suspected sensor fault.
   - **Further Monitoring**: Deploy a temporary reference hygrometer (if available) to capture RH for the next 24‑48 h while diagnostics are performed. Continue to monitor temperature and precipitation from the satellite model to confirm consistency.
   - **Sensor Servicing**: Follow the diagnostic steps above. Prioritize checking power and wiring, then clean/replace the probe filter. If the sensor still reports 100 % after recalibration, schedule a replacement of the HMP155 unit.
   - **Documentation**: Record the anomaly, diagnostic actions taken, and any corrective measures in the maintenance log. Update the sensor calibration record after service.

**Conclusion**: The combination of satellite weather data, sensor specifications, and known failure modes strongly indicates a sensor fault rather than a genuine atmospheric event. Implement the immediate response and maintenance actions to restore accurate humidity measurements and prevent future false alarms.[39m

**Comprehensive Evaluation of the Relative Humidity Anomaly (2024‑08‑19 07:40 UTC)**

1. **Current Weather Context**
   - Satellite‑based model data at the anomaly time shows temperature ≈ 29 °C (≈ 1 °C lower than the sensor’s 30.92 °C) and relative humidity ≈ 58‑59 % (far below the sensor’s reported 100 %).
   - Precipitation is 0 mm, matching the sensor’s rain report.  The surrounding environment therefore did not support saturation; a true 100 % RH reading is physically implausible.

2. **Sensor Specification Assessment**
   - The Vaisala HMP155 operates from 0‑100 % RH, but its accuracy near saturation is ±1.7 % RH and its resolution cannot reliably hold a perfectly stable 100 % value.
   - The observed exact 100 % reading, combined with a temperature that is higher than expected for that humidity, exceeds the sensor’s realistic performance envelope and aligns with the trend analysis flagging a likely fault.

3. **Troubleshooting & Maintenance Guidance**
   - Common failure modes that produce a constant 100 % reading include:
     * Wiring or power‑supply issues
     * Clogged or contaminated Teflon filter/probe
     * Sensor element degradation or moisture ingress
     * Calibration drift or internal temperature‑sensor fault
   - Recommended diagnostic steps:
     1. Verify correct wiring and secure connections; check for corrosion.
     2. Measure supply voltage (7‑28 V DC) and signal voltages at the sensor terminals.
     3. Inspect the probe for condensation, dust, or damage; clean or replace the sintered filter if needed.
     4. Compare the sensor’s internal temperature reading with a reference; abnormal values suggest a temperature‑sensor fault.
     5. Review calibration status and perform a recalibration using the USB interface or push‑button routine.
     6. Cross‑check output against a calibrated hygrometer; if discrepancy persists, replace the sensor element or the entire HMP155 unit.

4. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - **Immediate Response**: Flag the humidity data as unreliable in the data stream and exclude it from any operational decisions. Notify the station operator of the suspected sensor fault.
   - **Further Monitoring**: Deploy a temporary reference hygrometer (if available) to capture RH for the next 24‑48 h while diagnostics are performed. Continue to monitor temperature and precipitation from the satellite model to confirm consistency.
   - **Sensor Servicing**: Follow the diagnostic steps above. Prioritize checking power and wiring, then clean/replace the probe filter. If the sensor still reports 100 % after recalibration, schedule a replacement of the HMP155 unit.
   - **Documentation**: Record the anomaly, diagnostic actions taken, and any corrective measures in the maintenance log. Update the sensor calibration record after service.

**Conclusion**: The combination of satellite weather data, sensor specifications, and known failure modes strongly indicates a sensor fault rather than a genuine atmospheric event. Implement the immediate response and maintenance actions to restore accurate humidity measurements and prevent future false alarms.

    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
