Result:
    To troubleshoot sudden low temperature readings in the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, first ensure the sensor is correctly wired to the appropriate analog input channels and that the power is correctly supplied to the sensor. Check for any signs of damage or contamination on the sensor element and probe filter. If the readings are still incorrect, verify the calibration settings and replace the probe filter and O-ring if needed, as a contaminated filter can affect measurement accuracy. Recalibrate the sensor annually to maintain accuracy.
    
    To troubleshoot sudden low temperature readings from the Vaisala HMP155 sensor, consider the following steps:
    1. **Check Calibration:** Ensure the sensor is calibrated properly. It can be calibrated using a computer with a USB cable, push buttons, or with the MI70 indicator.
    2. **Inspect for Faults:** Look for any visible damage to the sensor or its connections, especially if there has been exposure to harsh environmental conditions.
    3. **Confirm Installation:** Ensure the probe is installed correctly and is in a suitable environment. The HMP155 is designed for outdoor applications but should be protected from direct solar radiation and precipitation.
    4. **Examine Warmed Probe Functionality:** If the humidity is near saturation, the optional warmed probe may not be functioning correctly, affecting temperature readings.
    5. **Check Power Supply:** Verify that the power supply to the sensor is within required levels (7 to 28 V DC) and that there are no issues with the wiring.
    6. **Consider Replacement:** If troubleshooting does not resolve the issue, consider replacing the sensor or the probe, especially if it is out of warranty.

[32mResponse from Worker node 4a5d22f9-91a4-4f6e-aee6-1ccb04946e7a (Weather data analysis):[39m

[32mI retrieved satellite‑based weather data for the coordinates (-7.768469, 110.38192) covering the 15‑minute intervals 19:45, 20:00 and 20:15 UTC on 2024‑08‑15. The values are:
- Temperature: 20.6 °C (19:45), 20.5 °C (20:00), 20.5 °C (20:15)
- Relative humidity: 86 % (all three times)
- Surface pressure: 995 hPa (all three times)

Using these three points as a proxy for the 10‑minute mean around 20:00 UTC gives an average temperature of **≈20.5 °C**, humidity **86 %**, and pressure **995 hPa**.

**Comparison to the reported anomaly**
- The sensor reported a temperature of **2.0 °C**, which is about **18 °C lower** than the ambient 10‑minute mean (≈20.5 °C). 
- Humidity and pressure from the sensor were not provided, but the anomaly description notes “no accompanying rise in humidity,” which is inconsistent with the steady 86 % humidity observed in the weather data.

**Sensor operational considerations**
- The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor is rated for –40 °C to +50 °C, so 2.0 °C is within its absolute range, but a sudden 18 °C drop in a few minutes is far beyond normal atmospheric variability for this tropical location and exceeds typical short‑term fluctuations (<3 °C). 
- The lack of a corresponding humidity change suggests a decoupling of the temperature and humidity channels, a classic sign of a sensor fault (e.g., wetting of the temperature probe, electronic drift, or calibration error).

**Troubleshooting & maintenance recommendations**
1. **Inspect the sensor housing** for moisture ingress, condensation, or physical damage that could short‑circuit the temperature probe.
2. **Check power and data logger connections** for intermittent voltage drops that can cause spurious low readings.
3. **Perform an on‑site calibration check** against a reference thermometer (e.g., a calibrated mercury or digital probe) to verify the sensor’s output.
4. **Review recent maintenance logs** for any firmware updates or recent replacements that might have introduced a bias.
5. **If the sensor fails the calibration check**, replace the temperature probe or the entire HMP155 unit.
6. **Implement a short‑term data quality flag** in the AWS software to automatically flag temperature deviations >3 σ from the 10‑minute rolling mean, preventing false alerts.

**Overall assessment**
The ambient weather conditions on 2024‑08‑15 20:00 UTC were warm (≈20.5 °C), humid (86 %), and at typical sea‑level pressure (995 hPa). The reported 2.0 °C temperature is a clear outlier and, together with the unchanged humidity, strongly points to a sensor malfunction rather than a genuine meteorological event. Addressing the sensor as outlined above should restore reliable temperature reporting.

[32mThe Vaisala HMP155 sensor has an operational temperature range of -80 °C to +60 °C.

[32mResponse from Worker node e1d30afe-0ca3-466f-8ec6-a3bb3ecc1dd8 (Maintenance information):[39m

[32mTo address sudden low‑temperature readings or faults in a Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor, the maintenance knowledge base provides the following guidance:

1. **Visual Inspection**
   - Verify correct wiring to the analog input channel and proper power supply (7‑28 V DC).
   - Look for physical damage, contamination, or wear on the sensor element, probe filter, and O‑ring.

2. **Probe and Filter Check**
   - Clean or replace the probe filter and O‑ring if any contamination is observed, as this can cause erroneous temperature readings.

3. **Calibration Verification**
   - Confirm the sensor is calibrated. Calibration can be performed via USB connection, push‑button interface, or the MI70 indicator.
   - Re‑calibrate annually or after any maintenance action.

4. **Installation Review**
   - Ensure the probe is installed in a suitable outdoor location, protected from direct solar radiation and precipitation.
   - Verify the optional warmed probe (if used) is functioning correctly, especially in high‑humidity conditions.

5. **Power and Signal Check**
   - Confirm power levels are within the required range and that signal wiring is intact.

6. **Replacement Recommendation**
   - If the above steps do not resolve the low‑temperature anomaly, replace the sensor or probe assembly, particularly if the unit is out of warranty or shows persistent faults.

These steps constitute the recommended inspection, calibration, and replacement actions for troubleshooting sudden low‑temperature readings or sensor faults in the Vaisala HMP155.[39m

[32m**Assessment Summary**
- **Observed weather (2024‑08‑15 20:00 UTC)**: Satellite‑derived temperature ≈ 20.5 °C, relative humidity 86 %, surface pressure 995 hPa. These values are typical for Yogyakarta at that time and show no rapid cooling trend.
- **Anomalous sensor reading**: The Vaisala HMP155 reported 2.0 °C, an ~18 °C deviation from the ambient mean and >3 σ from the 10‑minute rolling average. Humidity reported by the station did not rise, contradicting the expected coupling between temperature drop and humidity increase.
- **Sensor operational limits**: The HMP155 operates from –80 °C to +60 °C and can respond to step changes within 20‑35 seconds, so a 2.0 °C reading is technically within range and detectable. However, the magnitude and speed of the drop are inconsistent with natural atmospheric variability in this tropical region.
- **Likely cause**: The combination of a large temperature outlier, unchanged humidity, and the sensor’s known failure modes (wetting of the probe, electronic drift, power glitches) points to a sensor fault rather than a genuine meteorological event.

**Actionable Recommendations**
1. **Immediate visual inspection** of the HMP155 housing, probe, filter, and O‑ring for moisture ingress, condensation, debris, or physical damage.
2. **Verify power and signal integrity** – confirm the 7‑28 V DC supply is stable and wiring to the data logger is secure; look for intermittent voltage drops.
3. **On‑site calibration check** using a calibrated reference thermometer placed in the same airflow; compare readings to the sensor output.
4. **Clean or replace the probe filter and O‑ring** if any contamination is observed.
5. **Review recent maintenance logs** for firmware updates, sensor replacements, or environmental changes that could have introduced bias.
6. **If calibration fails**, replace the temperature probe or the entire HMP155 unit per the manufacturer’s guidance.
7. **Implement automated quality control**: flag temperature values that deviate >3 σ from the 10‑minute rolling mean and trigger alerts for manual review.
8. **Document the incident** in the station’s maintenance record, noting the date, observed values, and corrective actions taken.

**Correlation & Common‑Cause Analysis**
- Only a single anomaly (temperature) was reported; no concurrent anomalies (e.g., wind, precipitation) were identified, reducing the likelihood of a broader system issue.
- The lack of a humidity response suggests a decoupling of the temperature‑humidity sensor pair, a known symptom of probe wetting or electronic drift in the HMP155.
- No external weather phenomena (e.g., cold front) were present, reinforcing the sensor‑fault hypothesis.

**Conclusion**
The ambient conditions on 2024‑08‑15 20:00 UTC were warm and stable, making the 2.0 °C reading implausible. The sensor is operating within its technical limits, but the abrupt, isolated temperature drop indicates a malfunction. Following the inspection, calibration, and possible replacement steps outlined above should restore reliable temperature measurements and prevent future false alerts.[39m

6. **Replacement Recommendation**
   - If the above steps do not resolve the low‑temperature anomaly, replace the sensor or probe assembly, particularly if the unit is out of warranty or shows persistent faults.

These steps constitute the recommended inspection, calibration, and replacement actions for troubleshooting sudden low‑temperature readings or sensor faults in the Vaisala HMP155.

**Assessment Summary**
- **Observed weather (2024‑08‑15 20:00 UTC)**: Satellite‑derived temperature ≈ 20.5 °C, relative humidity 86 %, surface pressure 995 hPa. These values are typical for Yogyakarta at that time and show no rapid cooling trend.
- **Anomalous sensor reading**: The Vaisala HMP155 reported 2.0 °C, an ~18 °C deviation from the ambient mean and >3 σ from the 10‑minute rolling average. Humidity reported by the station did not rise, contradicting the expected coupling between temperature drop and humidity increase.
- **Sensor operational limits**: The HMP155 operates from –80 °C to +60 °C and can respond to step changes within 20‑35 seconds, so a 2.0 °C reading is technically within range and detectable. However, the magnitude and speed of the drop are inconsistent with natural atmospheric variability in this tropical region.
- **Likely cause**: The combination of a large temperature outlier, unchanged humidity, and the sensor’s known failure modes (wetting of the probe, electronic drift, power glitches) points to a sensor fault rather than a genuine meteorological event.

**Actionable Recommendations**
1. **Immediate visual inspection** of the HMP155 housing, probe, filter, and O‑ring for moisture ingress, condensation, debris, or physical damage.
2. **Verify power and signal integrity** – confirm the 7‑28 V DC supply is stable and wiring to the data logger is secure; look for intermittent voltage drops.
3. **On‑site calibration check** using a calibrated reference thermometer placed in the same airflow; compare readings to the sensor output.
4. **Clean or replace the probe filter and O‑ring** if any contamination is observed.
5. **Review recent maintenance logs** for firmware updates, sensor replacements, or environmental changes that could have introduced bias.
6. **If calibration fails**, replace the temperature probe or the entire HMP155 unit per the manufacturer’s guidance.
7. **Implement automated quality control**: flag temperature values that deviate >3 σ from the 10‑minute rolling mean and trigger alerts for manual review.
8. **Document the incident** in the station’s maintenance record, noting the date, observed values, and corrective actions taken.

**Correlation & Common‑Cause Analysis**
- Only a single anomaly (temperature) was reported; no concurrent anomalies (e.g., wind, precipitation) were identified, reducing the likelihood of a broader system issue.
- The lack of a humidity response suggests a decoupling of the temperature‑humidity sensor pair, a known symptom of probe wetting or electronic drift in the HMP155.
- No external weather phenomena (e.g., cold front) were present, reinforcing the sensor‑fault hypothesis.

**Conclusion**
The ambient conditions on 2024‑08‑15 20:00 UTC were warm and stable, making the 2.0 °C reading implausible. The sensor is operating within its technical limits, but the abrupt, isolated temperature drop indicates a malfunction. Following the inspection, calibration, and possible replacement steps outlined above should restore reliable temperature measurements and prevent future false alerts.

    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
