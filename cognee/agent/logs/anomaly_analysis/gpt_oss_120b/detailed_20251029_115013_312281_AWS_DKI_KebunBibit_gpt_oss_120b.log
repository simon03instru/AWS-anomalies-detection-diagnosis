[32mI retrieved the observed weather data for the requested time window (2024-08-16 14:30‑16:30 UTC) at the Cibubur location (lat -34.9285, lon 138.6007). At the exact timestamp of the anomaly (2024‑08‑16T15:30:00 UTC) the satellite‑derived observations show:
- Precipitation: **0.1 mm** (light drizzle, far below the reported 51 mm spike)
- Temperature: **12.1 °C**
- Relative humidity: **88 %**
- Wind speed: **22.0 m s⁻¹** (≈ 79 km/h, fairly strong breezy conditions)

All surrounding 15‑minute intervals (14:30‑16:30) also show consistently low precipitation (0.1 mm) and stable temperature, humidity, and wind values. This suggests that the satellite data does not support a sudden 51 mm rainfall event at that time. The observed conditions are typical of a light drizzle with high humidity and strong winds, which could be consistent with a passing weather front but not with a heavy rainstorm.

**Comparison:** The sensor’s 51 mm reading is > 500 times higher than the satellite‑derived 0.1 mm measurement, indicating a likely sensor fault or mis‑calibration rather than a true extreme rainfall event.

**Result:** The task was completed successfully.[39m

[32mAssessment:
- Satellite‑derived weather at Cibubur (2024‑08‑16T15:30 UTC) showed only 0.1 mm of precipitation, 12.1 °C temperature, 88 % humidity and strong winds (22 m s⁻¹). This contrasts sharply with the HyQuest TB4 sensor’s 51 mm spike, a >500‑fold difference, indicating the reading is not reflecting the actual atmospheric conditions.
- The TB4 sensor’s specifications (0‑700 mm hr⁻¹ range, ±3 % accuracy for 50‑100 mm) confirm that a 51 mm value is technically within its measurement capability, so the anomaly is not due to exceeding the sensor’s operational limits.
- Known failure modes for the TB4 (debris blockage, tipping‑bucket jam, wiring or PulseCount mis‑configuration, splash from high winds) can produce sudden high‑rainfall spikes.

Recommendations:
1. **Immediate inspection** – clean the catch filter, siphon and bucket interior; remove any debris that could cause a false tip.
2. **Mechanical check** – ensure the tipping bucket pivots freely and each tip registers correctly.
3. **Electrical verification** – inspect all wiring, especially SDI‑12 or other data‑logger connections; confirm PulseCount settings match the sensor’s calibration.
4. **Calibration test** – pour the standard 314 cc volume into the funnel and verify that the sensor records the expected tip count (≈1 mm).
5. **Wind‑induced splash mitigation** – if high winds are common, consider adding a splash guard or relocating the gauge to a more sheltered site.
6. **Post‑maintenance monitoring** – after corrective actions, compare the sensor’s rainfall values with the next 3‑hour satellite/nearby station data to confirm alignment.
7. **Long‑term** – schedule regular (monthly) cleaning and calibration, and keep a log of any recurring spikes for trend analysis.

Conclusion: The 51 mm reading is most likely a sensor fault rather than a true extreme event. Following the above troubleshooting and maintenance steps should resolve the issue and restore reliable rainfall measurements.[39m

    1. TIPPING BUCKET TAINGAUGE MODEL TB4 HYQUEST Solutions

The only routine maintenance required is cleaning. The following items should be checked
regularly for cleanliness:
 Catch filter
 Syphon (refer diagram 2)
 Interior of bucket
 Top surface of adjusting screws
 Enclosure locking screws - lightly lubricate after cleaning
 All insect screens


ELECTRICAL
Dual reed switches are provided for several reasons:
 Two isolated switches permit the control of two separate circuits; e.g. a local counter
and a telemetry circuit.
 Parallel connection of both switches increases the current carrying capacity of the
contact system if required.
 Parallel switch operation confers a degree of redundancy in locations where data from
the raingauge is critical to flood warning etc.

CALIBRATION
All gauges have been calibrated by Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd, prior to despatch.
The following products and services are available from Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd:
 Field Calibration Device, Model TB320, for routine field check calibrations,
supplied with operating instruction sheet refers to page FCD 110-01.
 Laboratory Calibration Unit, Model TB340, for calibration after servicing in
workshops, supplied with operating manual.
 Recalibration Service at Hyquest Solutions’ factory.
Please contact either Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd or our local distributor for further
information.


Troubleshooting
Symptom: No precipitation measurement
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count
instruction.
2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the
PulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.
Disconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check
of the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket
between the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket
is tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.
Symptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12
1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and
Table 7-3 [p. 10]).

Maintenance
During each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,
debris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.
Verify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket
tip.
Dismantling for cleaning
Regularly check the following items for cleanliness:
l Catch filter
l Siphon
l Interior of bucket
l Top surface of adjusting screws
l Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning
l Insect screens
To access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and
lifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).

2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base
Separate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the
siphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.

Disassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):
a. Unscrew nut
b. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body
c. Remove stem from siphon body
d. Unscrew cap
e. Clean all items

Reassembling the rain bucket
1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Push stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Replace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
CAUTION:
Do not over tighten.
Push filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.
5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure
the housing onto the base.

Calibration check
The sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the
adjustment screws have loosened.
Nevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting
upward on the housing.
2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.
3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated
cylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection
funnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).
4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39
times.
5. If the rain gage fails to record the correct number of tips, return the unit to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration (see Assistance at the back of this manual).

General Description
HyQuest Solutions’ TB6 is a non-syphoning 
high-quality tipping bucket rain gauge for 
measuring rainfall and precipitation in urban 
and rural locations. The TB6 is the device of 
choice for accurately measuring low rainfall 
events (0-50 mm/hr with better than +/-1 % 
accuracy), because the water passes through 
the nozzle and enters the bucket directly al-
lowing small rainfall events to be measured. 
The TB6’s tried and proven design ensures 
long-term, accurate and repeatable results. 
It is manufactured from high quality, dura-
ble materials ensuring long term stability in 
the harshest of environments. It consists of 
a robust powder-coated aluminium enclo-
sure, a UV-resistant ASA polymer base, and 
stainless steel fasteners and ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter. 
Easy maintenance
Removal of the outer enclosure and access 
to the tipping bucket mechanism and ﬁ  nger 
ﬁ  lter assembly is made easy with quick 
release fasteners. The ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter can be 
removed easily during a ﬁ  eld service. It 
ensures the collector catch area remains 
unblocked when leaves, bird droppings and 
other debris ﬁ  nd their way into the catch.
The TB6’s base incorporates two water 
outlets at the bottom allowing for wa-
ter collection and data veriﬁ  cation.
Output options
TB6 includes a dual output 24 V DC 
reed switch allowing for output redun-
dancy or the addition of a second data 
logger. The second output could also be 
used for connecting HyQuest Solutions’ 
current meter counter CMCbt paired 
with the free FCD application that allow 
for easy and accurate ﬁ  eld calibration 
even in noisy (urban) environments. The 
reed switch incorporates varistor protection 
against surges that may be induced on long, 
inappropriately shielded signal cables.

    1. TIPPING BUCKET TAINGAUGE MODEL TB4 HYQUEST Solutions

The only routine maintenance required is cleaning. The following items should be checked
regularly for cleanliness:
 Catch filter
 Syphon (refer diagram 2)
 Interior of bucket
 Top surface of adjusting screws
 Enclosure locking screws - lightly lubricate after cleaning
 All insect screens


ELECTRICAL
Dual reed switches are provided for several reasons:
 Two isolated switches permit the control of two separate circuits; e.g. a local counter
and a telemetry circuit.
 Parallel connection of both switches increases the current carrying capacity of the
contact system if required.
 Parallel switch operation confers a degree of redundancy in locations where data from
the raingauge is critical to flood warning etc.

CALIBRATION
All gauges have been calibrated by Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd, prior to despatch.
The following products and services are available from Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd:
 Field Calibration Device, Model TB320, for routine field check calibrations,
supplied with operating instruction sheet refers to page FCD 110-01.
 Laboratory Calibration Unit, Model TB340, for calibration after servicing in
workshops, supplied with operating manual.
 Recalibration Service at Hyquest Solutions’ factory.
Please contact either Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd or our local distributor for further
information.


Troubleshooting
Symptom: No precipitation measurement
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count
instruction.
2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the
PulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.
Disconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check
of the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket
between the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket
is tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.
Symptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12
1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and
Table 7-3 [p. 10]).

Maintenance
During each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,
debris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.
Verify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket
tip.
Dismantling for cleaning
Regularly check the following items for cleanliness:
l Catch filter
l Siphon
l Interior of bucket
l Top surface of adjusting screws
l Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning
l Insect screens
To access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and
lifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).

2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base
Separate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the
siphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.

Disassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):
a. Unscrew nut
b. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body
c. Remove stem from siphon body
d. Unscrew cap
e. Clean all items

Reassembling the rain bucket
1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Push stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Replace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
CAUTION:
Do not over tighten.
Push filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.
5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure
the housing onto the base.

Calibration check
The sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the
adjustment screws have loosened.
Nevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting
