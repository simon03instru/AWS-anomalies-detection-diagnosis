    To troubleshoot sudden spikes in the HyQuest TB4 rainfall sensor without changes in humidity, consider the following steps:
    
    1. **Check for Debris**: Ensure that the collection funnel, debris screen, siphoning mechanism, and tipping bucket assembly are free of debris, insects, and sediment.
    2. **Inspect Electrical Connections**: Verify that the sensor is correctly wired and that the pulse or control terminal specified in the installation instructions is used.
    3. **Continuity Check**: Disconnect the sensor from the data logger and perform a continuity check with an ohm meter to ensure the switches operate correctly.
    4. **Calibration Check**: Confirm that the sensor is properly calibrated and perform a calibration check as needed, especially if there are signs of malfunction.
    5. **Verify Installation**: Ensure the tipping bucket assembly moves freely and is properly installed in the correct orientation. If it fails to tip accurately, it may need servicing. 
    
    Regular maintenance is crucial to prevent such issues.
    
    To troubleshoot sudden spikes in readings from the HyQuest TB4 rainfall sensor without accompanying humidity changes, consider the following steps:
    
    1. **Check for Debris**: Inspect the tipping bucket mechanism and the finger filter for blockages. Leaves, bird droppings, or other debris can cause inaccurate readings.
    
    2. **Verify Calibration**: Ensure the sensor is properly calibrated. Use the Portable Field Calibration Device (FCD) for functional tests in the field.
    
    3. **Examine Environmental Factors**: Sudden spikes could be due to environmental conditions such as wind or vibrations affecting the sensor. Ensure it’s securely mounted.
    
    4. **Electrical Interference**: Check for electrical surges or noise in the vicinity that might affect sensor operation. The TB4 includes varistor protection against surges; ensure this is functioning correctly.
    
    5. **Inspect for Damage**: Examine the physical condition of the sensor and its components, including the enclosure and internal mechanisms, for any signs of wear or damage.
    
    Taking these steps can help identify and resolve issues causing false readings.

[32mAt the time of the reported anomaly (2024-08-19T07:40:00 UTC) the satellite‑derived weather data for Yogyakarta (lat -7.81665, lon 110.29481) show:
- Temperature: ~29 °C (rising to 29.0 °C at 07:30 and slightly dropping to 28.8 °C at 07:45)
- Precipitation: 0.0 mm (no rain recorded in the 15‑minute intervals surrounding the event)
- Relative humidity: ~60 % (stable across the interval)
- Windspeed: very strong, ~20 m s⁻¹ (≈72 km h⁻¹) at both 07:30 and 07:45
- Surface pressure: ~993.6 hPa (low pressure typical of a passing trough)

The anomaly description notes a sudden 20 mm rainfall spike in a 10‑minute window, yet the weather data show **no precipitation** and **no accompanying rise in humidity**. The only notable atmospheric feature at that time is the **strong wind**. High winds can cause mechanical disturbances, splashing, or vortex‑induced errors in rain gauges, especially low‑cost DIY sensors like the HyQuest TB4. This makes a wind‑induced false positive a plausible explanation.

**Assessment & Recommendations**
1. **Sensor verification** – Compare the HyQuest TB4 reading with a nearby reference gauge (if available) for the same period. A discrepancy would confirm a false alarm.
2. **Inspect the gauge** – Check for water ingress, blockage, or debris that could have been displaced by the strong wind.
3. **Calibration & shielding** – Re‑calibrate the sensor according to the manufacturer’s guidelines and consider adding a wind shield or placing the gauge in a more protected location.
4. **Data quality checks** – Implement automated checks that flag rainfall spikes exceeding a threshold (e.g., >5 mm in 10 min) when concurrent humidity and satellite precipitation are low, prompting manual review.
5. **Maintenance schedule** – Perform routine cleaning and visual inspection after high‑wind events (>15 m s⁻¹) to prevent similar anomalies.

Overall, the weather conditions at the anomaly time do not support a genuine heavy rain event; the strong wind is the most likely factor contributing to the erroneous 20 mm reading.[39m

[32mAssessment: The satellite‑based weather data for Yogyakarta at 07:40 local (00:40 UTC) shows temperature ~23.5 °C, humidity ~80 % and zero precipitation. The HyQuest TB4 sensor reported a 20 mm rainfall spike in 10 min, which translates to 120 mm h⁻¹ – within the sensor’s 0‑700 mm h⁻¹ range but outside its high‑accuracy band (0‑50 mm h⁻¹). The lack of concurrent humidity increase and the discrepancy with satellite data strongly suggest a sensor fault rather than a real event.

Potential causes (per maintenance KB): debris or blockage in the funnel/tipping bucket, stuck or mis‑aligned bucket, electrical connection problems, calibration drift, wind/vibration effects.

Recommended actions:
1. Visually inspect and clean the collection funnel, screen, and tipping‑bucket mechanism.
2. Verify all wiring connections, check for corrosion or loose terminals, and perform a continuity test.
3. Confirm the bucket moves freely; lubricate or adjust if stuck.
4. Re‑calibrate the sensor using a field calibration kit or replace if calibration cannot be restored.
5. Secure the sensor mounting to reduce wind‑induced vibration; consider adding a wind shield if needed.
6. Review power supply stability and add surge protection if electrical surges are suspected.
7. After maintenance, monitor the sensor for at least 24 h and compare readings with nearby reference stations to confirm normal operation.

    1. TIPPING BUCKET TAINGAUGE MODEL TB4 HYQUEST Solutions

The only routine maintenance required is cleaning. The following items should be checked
regularly for cleanliness:
 Catch filter
 Syphon (refer diagram 2)
 Interior of bucket
 Top surface of adjusting screws
 Enclosure locking screws - lightly lubricate after cleaning
 All insect screens


ELECTRICAL
Dual reed switches are provided for several reasons:
 Two isolated switches permit the control of two separate circuits; e.g. a local counter
and a telemetry circuit.
 Parallel connection of both switches increases the current carrying capacity of the
contact system if required.
 Parallel switch operation confers a degree of redundancy in locations where data from
the raingauge is critical to flood warning etc.

CALIBRATION
All gauges have been calibrated by Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd, prior to despatch.
The following products and services are available from Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd:
 Field Calibration Device, Model TB320, for routine field check calibrations,
supplied with operating instruction sheet refers to page FCD 110-01.
 Laboratory Calibration Unit, Model TB340, for calibration after servicing in
workshops, supplied with operating manual.
 Recalibration Service at Hyquest Solutions’ factory.
Please contact either Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd or our local distributor for further
information.


Troubleshooting
Symptom: No precipitation measurement
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count
instruction.
2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the
PulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.
Disconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check
of the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket
between the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket
is tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.
Symptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12
1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and
Table 7-3 [p. 10]).

Maintenance
During each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,
debris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.
Verify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket
tip.
Dismantling for cleaning
Regularly check the following items for cleanliness:
l Catch filter
l Siphon
l Interior of bucket
l Top surface of adjusting screws
l Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning
l Insect screens
To access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and
lifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).

2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base
Separate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the
siphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.

Disassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):
a. Unscrew nut
b. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body
c. Remove stem from siphon body
d. Unscrew cap
e. Clean all items

Reassembling the rain bucket
1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Push stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Replace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
CAUTION:
Do not over tighten.
Push filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.
5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure
the housing onto the base.

Calibration check
The sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the
adjustment screws have loosened.
Nevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting
upward on the housing.
2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.
3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated
cylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection
funnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).
4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39
times.
5. If the rain gage fails to record the correct number of tips, return the unit to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration (see Assistance at the back of this manual).

General Description
HyQuest Solutions’ TB6 is a non-syphoning 
high-quality tipping bucket rain gauge for 
measuring rainfall and precipitation in urban 
and rural locations. The TB6 is the device of 
choice for accurately measuring low rainfall 
events (0-50 mm/hr with better than +/-1 % 
accuracy), because the water passes through 
the nozzle and enters the bucket directly al-
lowing small rainfall events to be measured. 
The TB6’s tried and proven design ensures 
long-term, accurate and repeatable results. 
It is manufactured from high quality, dura-
ble materials ensuring long term stability in 
the harshest of environments. It consists of 
a robust powder-coated aluminium enclo-
sure, a UV-resistant ASA polymer base, and 
stainless steel fasteners and ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter. 
Easy maintenance
Removal of the outer enclosure and access 
to the tipping bucket mechanism and ﬁ  nger 
ﬁ  lter assembly is made easy with quick 
release fasteners. The ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter can be 
removed easily during a ﬁ  eld service. It 
ensures the collector catch area remains 
unblocked when leaves, bird droppings and 
other debris ﬁ  nd their way into the catch.
The TB6’s base incorporates two water 
outlets at the bottom allowing for wa-
ter collection and data veriﬁ  cation.
Output options
TB6 includes a dual output 24 V DC 
reed switch allowing for output redun-
dancy or the addition of a second data 
logger. The second output could also be 
used for connecting HyQuest Solutions’ 
current meter counter CMCbt paired 
with the free FCD application that allow 
for easy and accurate ﬁ  eld calibration 
even in noisy (urban) environments. The 
reed switch incorporates varistor protection 
against surges that may be induced on long, 
inappropriately shielded signal cables.
Main Features
  Standard 200 mm diameter catch
  Long term stable calibration
  Minimal maintenance required
  Robust design for all environments
  Optional: autonomous real-time rain 
monitoring and reporting system

Troubleshooting
Symptom: No precipitation measurement
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count
instruction.
2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the
PulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.
Disconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check
of the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket
between the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket
is tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.
Symptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12
1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and
Table 7-3 [p. 10]).

Maintenance
During each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,
debris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.
Verify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket
tip.
Dismantling for cleaning
Regularly check the following items for cleanliness:
l Catch filter
l Siphon
l Interior of bucket
l Top surface of adjusting screws
l Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning
l Insect screens
To access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and
lifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).

2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base
Separate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the
siphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.

Disassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):
a. Unscrew nut
b. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body
c. Remove stem from siphon body
d. Unscrew cap
e. Clean all items

Reassembling the rain bucket
1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Push stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Replace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
CAUTION:
Do not over tighten.
Push filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.
5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure
the housing onto the base.

Calibration check
The sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the
adjustment screws have loosened.
Nevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting
upward on the housing.
2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.
3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated
cylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection
funnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).
4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39
times.
5. If the rain gage fails to record the correct number of tips, return the unit to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration (see Assistance at the back of this manual).

General Description
HyQuest Solutions’ TB6 is a non-syphoning 
high-quality tipping bucket rain gauge for 
measuring rainfall and precipitation in urban 
and rural locations. The TB6 is the device of 
choice for accurately measuring low rainfall 
events (0-50 mm/hr with better than +/-1 % 
accuracy), because the water passes through 
the nozzle and enters the bucket directly al-
lowing small rainfall events to be measured. 
The TB6’s tried and proven design ensures 
long-term, accurate and repeatable results. 
It is manufactured from high quality, dura-
ble materials ensuring long term stability in 
the harshest of environments. It consists of 
a robust powder-coated aluminium enclo-
sure, a UV-resistant ASA polymer base, and 
stainless steel fasteners and ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter. 
Easy maintenance
Removal of the outer enclosure and access 
to the tipping bucket mechanism and ﬁ  nger 
ﬁ  lter assembly is made easy with quick 
release fasteners. The ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter can be 
removed easily during a ﬁ  eld service. It 
ensures the collector catch area remains 
unblocked when leaves, bird droppings and 
other debris ﬁ  nd their way into the catch.
The TB6’s base incorporates two water 
outlets at the bottom allowing for wa-
ter collection and data veriﬁ  cation.
Output options
TB6 includes a dual output 24 V DC 
reed switch allowing for output redun-
dancy or the addition of a second data 
logger. The second output could also be 
used for connecting HyQuest Solutions’ 
current meter counter CMCbt paired 
with the free FCD application that allow 
for easy and accurate ﬁ  eld calibration 
even in noisy (urban) environments. The 
reed switch incorporates varistor protection 
against surges that may be induced on long, 
inappropriately shielded signal cables.
Main Features
  Standard 200 mm diameter catch
  Long term stable calibration
  Minimal maintenance required
  Robust design for all environments
  Optional: autonomous real-time rain 
monitoring and reporting system
