[32mAnalysis of weather data around the event detection time of 2024-08-15T20:00:00 at AWS_DIY_UGM shows the following: The temperature from weather data is steady around 20.5°C, which is consistent with typical conditions for the location and time. There is no precipitation detected, relative humidity is stable around 86-87%, windspeed is moderate around 5.5-5.9 m/s, wind direction is consistent from northwest (317°-328°), and surface pressure is stable near 995 hPa. Comparing this with the reported anomaly of a sudden temperature drop to 2.0°C (about 20°C below the 10-minute mean), the anomaly appears isolated to the temperature sensor only. No other weather parameters show anomalies or unusual trends at the same time. Therefore, there are no multiple anomalies detected concurrently. The temperature anomaly is likely a sensor fault as previously concluded, with no correlated anomalies in humidity, wind, precipitation, or pressure to suggest a common meteorological cause. Recommendations remain to focus on sensor maintenance and calibration for the temperature sensor. No broader weather event or multiple anomaly correlation is evident from the data.[39m

[32mThe weather data for UGM Yogyakarta, Indonesia on August 15, 2024, around 20:00 UTC shows a temperature of approximately 20.5°C with relative humidity around 86-87%. This temperature is consistent over the hour from 19:00 to 21:00 UTC, with only minor fluctuations between 20.7°C and 20.2°C. The relative humidity remains steady in the mid-80s percentage range.

Comparing this to the anomalous temperature reading of 2.0°C reported by the sensor at the same time, there is a significant deviation of about 18.5°C below the typical temperature observed from satellite-based weather data. Such a low temperature is highly unusual for this tropical location and time, where temperatures typically hover around 20°C in the evening.

The relative humidity does not show a corresponding increase that would be expected if the temperature had truly dropped so drastically, supporting the likelihood that the 2.0°C reading is a sensor fault rather than an actual weather condition.

In summary, the typical temperature range at this time is around 20-21°C with humidity around 85-87%. The anomalous 2.0°C reading is far outside this range and inconsistent with humidity data, indicating a probable sensor malfunction rather than a true meteorological event.[39m

[32mThe Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor has an operational temperature range of -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F). The reported temperature of 2.0°C is well within the normal operating parameters of the sensor. The sensor uses a PT100 temperature sensor element, which typically provides high sensitivity and accuracy for temperature measurements. Given the operational range and typical sensitivity of the PT100 sensor, the sudden drop to 2.0°C (approximately 20°C below the 10-minute mean of ~22°C) is not due to the sensor's operational limits or sensitivity but likely indicates a sensor fault or anomaly as suggested by the trend analysis. Therefore, the sensor sensitivity matches the capability to detect such a temperature drop, but the anomaly is likely not a true environmental change but a sensor error.[39m

[32mAssessment Report on Temperature Anomaly at AWS_DIY_UGM Station

1. Overview of Anomaly:
- Event Detection Time: 2024-08-15T20:00:00 UTC
- Location: UGM Yogyakarta, Indonesia (Lat: -7.768469, Lon: 110.38192)
- Anomaly: Sudden temperature drop to 2.0°C, approximately 20°C below the 10-minute mean (~22°C), exceeding 3 standard deviations.
- Sensor: Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor.

2. Weather Condition Comparison:
- Satellite-based weather data around the anomaly time shows stable temperatures around 20.5°C with relative humidity approximately 86-87%.
- No corresponding increase in humidity or other weather parameters (precipitation, windspeed, surface pressure) that would support a true temperature drop.
- Typical temperature range for the location and time is around 20-21°C, making the 2.0°C reading highly inconsistent with actual weather.

3. Sensor Operational Parameters and Sensitivity:
- Vaisala HMP155 sensor operates reliably within -80°C to +60°C, so 2.0°C is within operational range.
- Sensor sensitivity and accuracy are sufficient to detect sudden temperature changes.
- The sudden drop is not due to sensor limitations but likely a fault or anomaly.

4. Troubleshooting and Maintenance Insights:
- Common causes for such anomalies include contaminated sensor filters, wiring issues, electrical interference, water ingress, corrosion, or calibration drift.
- Recommended maintenance actions include inspecting and verifying wiring and connections, cleaning or replacing the sensor filter and radiation shield, checking for corrosion or water damage, recalibrating the sensor, and replacing the sensor element if faults persist.

5. Correlation with Other Anomalies:
- No other anomalies detected in humidity, wind, precipitation, or pressure around the event time.

FINAL OUTPUT - SYNTHESIZED RESULT
================================================================================
--- Subtask 1a2def03-88f8-45ea-9792-f170868f8cc6.1 Result ---
The weather data for UGM Yogyakarta, Indonesia on August 15, 2024, around 20:00 UTC shows a temperature of approximately 20.5°C with relative humidity around 86-87%. This temperature is consistent over the hour from 19:00 to 21:00 UTC, with only minor fluctuations between 20.7°C and 20.2°C. The relative humidity remains steady in the mid-80s percentage range.

Comparing this to the anomalous temperature reading of 2.0°C reported by the sensor at the same time, there is a significant deviation of about 18.5°C below the typical temperature observed from satellite-based weather data. Such a low temperature is highly unusual for this tropical location and time, where temperatures typically hover around 20°C in the evening.

The relative humidity does not show a corresponding increase that would be expected if the temperature had truly dropped so drastically, supporting the likelihood that the 2.0°C reading is a sensor fault rather than an actual weather condition.

In summary, the typical temperature range at this time is around 20-21°C with humidity around 85-87%. The anomalous 2.0°C reading is far outside this range and inconsistent with humidity data, indicating a probable sensor malfunction rather than a true meteorological event.

--- Subtask 1a2def03-88f8-45ea-9792-f170868f8cc6.2 Result ---
The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor has an operational temperature range of -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F). The reported temperature of 2.0°C is well within the normal operating parameters of the sensor. The sensor uses a PT100 temperature sensor element, which typically provides high sensitivity and accuracy for temperature measurements. Given the operational range and typical sensitivity of the PT100 sensor, the sudden drop to 2.0°C (approximately 20°C below the 10-minute mean of ~22°C) is not due to the sensor's operational limits or sensitivity but likely indicates a sensor fault or anomaly as suggested by the trend analysis. Therefore, the sensor sensitivity matches the capability to detect such a temperature drop, but the anomaly is likely not a true environmental change but a sensor error.

Assessment Report on Temperature Anomaly at AWS_DIY_UGM Station

1. Overview of Anomaly:
- Event Detection Time: 2024-08-15T20:00:00 UTC
- Location: UGM Yogyakarta, Indonesia (Lat: -7.768469, Lon: 110.38192)
- Anomaly: Sudden temperature drop to 2.0°C, approximately 20°C below the 10-minute mean (~22°C), exceeding 3 standard deviations.
- Sensor: Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor.

2. Weather Condition Comparison:
- Satellite-based weather data around the anomaly time shows stable temperatures around 20.5°C with relative humidity approximately 86-87%.
- No corresponding increase in humidity or other weather parameters (precipitation, windspeed, surface pressure) that would support a true temperature drop.
- Typical temperature range for the location and time is around 20-21°C, making the 2.0°C reading highly inconsistent with actual weather.

3. Sensor Operational Parameters and Sensitivity:
- Vaisala HMP155 sensor operates reliably within -80°C to +60°C, so 2.0°C is within operational range.
- Sensor sensitivity and accuracy are sufficient to detect sudden temperature changes.
- The sudden drop is not due to sensor limitations but likely a fault or anomaly.

4. Troubleshooting and Maintenance Insights:
- Common causes for such anomalies include contaminated sensor filters, wiring issues, electrical interference, water ingress, corrosion, or calibration drift.
- Recommended maintenance actions include inspecting and verifying wiring and connections, cleaning or replacing the sensor filter and radiation shield, checking for corrosion or water damage, recalibrating the sensor, and replacing the sensor element if faults persist.

5. Correlation with Other Anomalies:
- No other anomalies detected in humidity, wind, precipitation, or pressure around the event time.
- The temperature anomaly is isolated, supporting the conclusion of a sensor fault rather than a meteorological event.

6. Conclusion:
- The temperature anomaly is highly likely caused by a sensor fault rather than actual weather conditions.
- The anomaly is inconsistent with all other weather data and typical environmental conditions.

7. Recommendations:
- Conduct immediate physical inspection of the Vaisala HMP155 sensor and its installation.
- Perform cleaning and maintenance as per manufacturer guidelines.
- Recalibrate the sensor to verify accuracy.
- Monitor sensor output closely after maintenance to confirm resolution.
- Consider temporary replacement of the sensor if faults persist to ensure data integrity.
- Document all maintenance and calibration activities for future reference.

Analysis of weather data around the event detection time of 2024-08-15T20:00:00 at AWS_DIY_UGM shows the following: The temperature from weather data is steady around 20.5°C, which is consistent with typical conditions for the location and time. There is no precipitation detected, relative humidity is stable around 86-87%, windspeed is moderate around 5.5-5.9 m/s, wind direction is consistent from northwest (317°-328°), and surface pressure is stable near 995 hPa. Comparing this with the reported anomaly of a sudden temperature drop to 2.0°C (about 20°C below the 10-minute mean), the anomaly appears isolated to the temperature sensor only. No other weather parameters show anomalies or unusual trends at the same time. Therefore, there are no multiple anomalies detected concurrently. The temperature anomaly is likely a sensor fault as previously concluded, with no correlated anomalies in humidity, wind, precipitation, or pressure to suggest a common meteorological cause. Recommendations remain to focus on sensor maintenance and calibration for the temperature sensor. No broader weather event or multiple anomaly correlation is evident from the data.

  Document Chunks:
    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.

HMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature
measurement. It is designed especially for demanding
outdoor applications.

HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.

    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed
every yea

    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed
every yea

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
