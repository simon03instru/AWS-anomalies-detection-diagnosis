[32mThe weather data for Cibubur, Indonesia around August 16, 2024, 15:30 UTC shows surface pressure values consistently around 1006 hPa, ranging from 1005.9 to 1006.2 hPa within the hour around the specified time. This is within the normal atmospheric pressure range for the location and typical global sea-level pressure values. In contrast, the anomalous sensor reading of 100.58 hPa is physically impossible and far below the expected range, indicating a likely sensor fault. The normal pressure range observed is approximately 1005.9 to 1006.2 hPa, which is consistent with typical atmospheric conditions, while the anomalous reading deviates by nearly 900 hPa, confirming it as an error. Therefore, the sensor reading should be considered invalid, and maintenance or sensor replacement is recommended.[39m

[32mUpon investigation of the AWS_DKI_KebunBibit station data around the anomaly detection time (2024-08-16T15:30:00), the only confirmed anomaly is the atmospheric pressure reading of 100.58 hPa, which is physically impossible and far below the normal range. The actual surface pressure values from weather data for the location during that period are consistently around 1006 hPa, which is typical and within expected ranges. Other weather parameters such as temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction show no abnormal values or anomalies. Therefore, no multiple anomalies are present at the station. The atmospheric pressure anomaly is likely due to a sensor fault, with no correlated anomalies in other weather parameters. Maintenance or sensor replacement is recommended to address this isolated sensor error.[39m

[32mAssessment Report on Atmospheric Pressure Anomaly at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit on August 16, 2024

1. Overview of Anomaly:
The atmospheric pressure sensor at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit recorded an anomalous pressure value of 100.58 hPa at 15:30 UTC on August 16, 2024. This reading is physically impossible given typical atmospheric pressure ranges and deviates by nearly 900 hPa from the expected mean pressure of approximately 1002.9 hPa for the location.

2. Weather Data Comparison:
Historical weather data around the anomaly time shows surface pressure consistently around 1006 hPa, which is within the normal range for Cibubur, Indonesia. The anomalous reading is thus an extreme outlier and not representative of actual atmospheric conditions.

3. Sensor Specifications and Operational Range:
The Vaisala PTB110 sensor used has an operational pressure range suitable for typical atmospheric pressures (approximately 950-1050 hPa). The anomalous reading of 100.58 hPa is well outside this range, indicating a sensor fault. The sensor's sensitivity adjustments (0.05 hPa steps) cannot account for such a large deviation.

4. Troubleshooting and Maintenance Insights:
Common failure modes for the Vaisala PTB110 include sensor malfunction, miscalibration, wiring issues, and environmental factors such as humidity or condensation. Recommended maintenance actions include:
- Verifying correct sensor card insertion and wiring connections.
- Checking and recalibrating the sensor to correct potential calibration drift.
- Replacing desiccants to prevent humidity-related errors.
- Ensuring the sensor operates within specified environmental conditions.
- Conducting regular functional tests and inspections.

5. Recommendations:
- Immediate verification of sensor wiring and installation to rule out connection faults.
- Send the sensor for professional recalibration to restore measurement accuracy.
- If recalibration does not resolve the issue, consider sensor replacement due to probable hardware malfunction.
- Implement routine maintenance schedules including environmental checks and functional testing to prevent recurrence.

6. Conclusion:
The atmospheric pressure anomaly detected is due to a sensor fault rather than actual atmospheric conditions. Prompt sensor verification, recalibration, or replacement is essential to ensure data reliability and operational integrity of AWS_DKI_KebunBibit station.

This assessment aligns with the trend analysis and all gathered information, providing a clear path for corrective action.[39m

Assessment Report on Atmospheric Pressure Anomaly at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit on August 16, 2024

1. Overview of Anomaly:
The atmospheric pressure sensor at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit recorded an anomalous pressure value of 100.58 hPa at 15:30 UTC on August 16, 2024. This reading is physically impossible given typical atmospheric pressure ranges and deviates by nearly 900 hPa from the expected mean pressure of approximately 1002.9 hPa for the location.

2. Weather Data Comparison:
Historical weather data around the anomaly time shows surface pressure consistently around 1006 hPa, which is within the normal range for Cibubur, Indonesia. The anomalous reading is thus an extreme outlier and not representative of actual atmospheric conditions.

3. Sensor Specifications and Operational Range:
The Vaisala PTB110 sensor used has an operational pressure range suitable for typical atmospheric pressures (approximately 950-1050 hPa). The anomalous reading of 100.58 hPa is well outside this range, indicating a sensor fault. The sensor's sensitivity adjustments (0.05 hPa steps) cannot account for such a large deviation.

4. Troubleshooting and Maintenance Insights:
Common failure modes for the Vaisala PTB110 include sensor malfunction, miscalibration, wiring issues, and environmental factors such as humidity or condensation. Recommended maintenance actions include:
- Verifying correct sensor card insertion and wiring connections.
- Checking and recalibrating the sensor to correct potential calibration drift.
- Replacing desiccants to prevent humidity-related errors.
- Ensuring the sensor operates within specified environmental conditions.
- Conducting regular functional tests and inspections.

5. Recommendations:
- Immediate verification of sensor wiring and installation to rule out connection faults.
- Send the sensor for professional recalibration to restore measurement accuracy.
- If recalibration does not resolve the issue, consider sensor replacement due to probable hardware malfunction.
- Implement routine maintenance schedules including environmental checks and functional testing to prevent recurrence.

6. Conclusion:
The atmospheric pressure anomaly detected is due to a sensor fault rather than actual atmospheric conditions. Prompt sensor verification, recalibration, or replacement is essential to ensure data reliability and operational integrity of AWS_DKI_KebunBibit station.

This assessment aligns with the trend analysis and all gathered information, providing a clear path for corrective action.

--- Subtask 750abd1b-884f-4e02-9f82-371a092f23f5.5 Result ---
Upon investigation of the AWS_DKI_KebunBibit station data around the anomaly detection time (2024-08-16T15:30:00), the only confirmed anomaly is the atmospheric pressure reading of 100.58 hPa, which is physically impossible and far below the normal range. The actual surface pressure values from weather data for the location during that period are consistently around 1006 hPa, which is typical and within expected ranges. Other weather parameters such as temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction show no abnormal values or anomalies. Therefore, no multiple anomalies are present at the station. The atmospheric pressure anomaly is likely due to a sensor fault, with no correlated anomalies in other weather parameters. Maintenance or sensor replacement is recommended to address this isolated sensor error.

    1. PTB110 Maintenance
PTB110 does not require regular maintenance.
The sensor has no replaceable parts. If the sensor malfunctions, replace it.

ADJUSTMENT AND CALIBRATION
Calibration of the PTB110 series barometers is NIST traceable
and the barometers are supplied with a NIST traceable
calibration certificate.
There are two push buttons available for the offset fine
adjustment inside the barometer (see the figure on the previous
page). The adjustment step is 0.05 hPa.
OPERATING THE BUTTONS
Restoring Adjustments
To restore the adjustments, press and hold down the left button
while switching on the barometer. After releasing the button, a
green LED starts flashing.
When the factory adjustments are in use, the green LED flashes
twice. When the user adjustments are in use, the green LED
flashes three times.
Now you can change the factory adjustments to user adjustments
or vice versa by pressing the left button.
Return to the normal operating mode by switching the power off
and on in sequence.
Using Analog Output Test Mode
To activate the test mode, press and hold down the right button
while switching on the barometer.
