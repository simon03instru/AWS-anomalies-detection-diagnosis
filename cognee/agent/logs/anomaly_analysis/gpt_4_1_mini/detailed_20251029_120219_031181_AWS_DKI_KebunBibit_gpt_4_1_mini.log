[32mThe weather data for Cibubur, Indonesia around August 16, 2024, 15:30 UTC shows a temperature of approximately 12.1°C and a wind direction of about 265° at 10 meters height. Comparing this to the reported anomalies: the wind direction anomaly value of -9999.0° is clearly an invalid sentinel value indicating sensor failure, as normal wind direction values are around 265°, which is a typical and plausible reading. The temperature anomaly reported as 15.0°C is higher than the satellite-based observed temperature of around 12.1°C, but not drastically different. However, the anomaly report mentioned a 13°C drop from a 10-minute mean of 28.1°C, which suggests the sensor reading of 15.0°C is indeed an abrupt and unusual drop compared to expected conditions. In summary, the wind direction anomaly is a sensor communication failure, while the temperature anomaly represents a significant deviation from expected values, likely due to sensor malfunction. The normal weather data does not support the anomalous readings, confirming the sensor issues. Maintenance should focus on sensor diagnostics and replacement or recalibration to resolve these faults.[39m

[32mThe Young 05103-L wind direction sensor operates within a range of 0 to 360 degrees with a resolution of 0.5 degrees. The anomalous wind direction value of -9999.0° is a sentinel value indicating sensor communication failure and is clearly outside the normal operational range of this sensor.

The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor operates within a temperature range of -80 to +60 °C. It has an accuracy that varies slightly depending on the output type but generally provides reliable measurements within this range. The reported temperature anomaly of 15.0 °C falls well within the normal operational range of the HMP155 sensor. However, the trend analysis indicates this value is a 13°C drop below the 10-minute mean and a >3σ deviation, suggesting a sensor malfunction rather than an out-of-range measurement.

In summary, the wind direction anomaly (-9999.0) is outside the sensor's operational parameters and indicates a fault, while the temperature value (15.0 °C) is within the sensor's operational range but likely represents a malfunction due to the abrupt deviation from expected values.[39m

The Young 05103-L wind direction sensor operates within a range of 0 to 360 degrees with a resolution of 0.5 degrees. The anomalous wind direction value of -9999.0° is a sentinel value indicating sensor communication failure and is clearly outside the normal operational range of this sensor.

The Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor operates within a temperature range of -80 to +60 °C. It has an accuracy that varies slightly depending on the output type but generally provides reliable measurements within this range. The reported temperature anomaly of 15.0 °C falls well within the normal operational range of the HMP155 sensor. However, the trend analysis indicates this value is a 13°C drop below the 10-minute mean and a >3σ deviation, suggesting a sensor malfunction rather than an out-of-range measurement.

In summary, the wind direction anomaly (-9999.0) is outside the sensor's operational parameters and indicates a fault, while the temperature value (15.0 °C) is within the sensor's operational range but likely represents a malfunction due to the abrupt deviation from expected values.

For the Young 05103-L wind direction sensor, common anomalies include invalid readings such as -9999 due to sensor communication failure, often caused by wiring issues, incorrect excitation voltage, or potentiometer faults. Troubleshooting steps include checking sensor wiring, verifying excitation voltage and datalogger settings, inspecting potentiometer resistance, and ensuring correct sensor orientation. Common failure modes include noisy bearings, mechanical jams, sensor drift, and electrical failures. Recommended maintenance involves inspecting and replacing bearings every 24 months, recalibrating the sensor using the Vane Angle Bench Stand, checking vane torque, and cleaning the vane to prevent obstructions.

For the Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor, anomalies like abrupt temperature drops and broken correlation with humidity suggest sensor malfunction possibly due to sensor damage, contamination, or electrical failures. Troubleshooting includes checking sensor condition and connection integrity. Common failure modes include sensor drift and electrical issues. Maintenance recommendations are regular calibration per manufacturer guidelines and ensuring environmental protection to avoid damage.

Actionable maintenance recommendations:
1. For Young 05103-L: Inspect and repair wiring, verify excitation voltage and datalogger configuration, check and replace bearings if noisy, recalibrate sensor regularly, and clean the vane.
2. For Vaisala HMP155: Inspect sensor for damage or contamination, verify electrical connections, perform regular calibration, and protect sensor from harsh environmental conditions.

    1. R.M. Young Wind Monitor maintenance
Preventive maintenance for R.M. Young Wind Monitor includes:

-Checking the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer at least every second year. If the bearings are noisy or wind speed threshold increases above an acceptable level, replace the bearings.
After replacing the bearings, update the maintenance information in the Web UI.
-If the sensor measurement data looks suspicious after the maintenance operation, recalibrate the sensor.
R.M. Young suggests that the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer be
inspected at least every 24 months. Only a qualified technician should perform
the replacement.
Troubleshooting
7.1 Wind Direction
Symptom: -9999 or no change in direction
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Excitation and Single-Ended channel
specified by the measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the excitation voltage and Range code are correct for the
datalogger type.
3. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohn meter to check the
potentiometer. Resistance should be about 10K ohms between the Blue and
White wires. The resistance between either the Blue/Green or White/Green
wires should vary between 1K to 11K depending on the vane position.
Resistance when the vane is in the 5 degree dead band should be about 1 M
ohm.
Symptom: Incorrect wind direction
1. Verify that the Excitation voltage, Range code, multiplier and offset
parameters are correct for the datalogger type.
2. Check orientation of sensor, as described in Section 3.
7.2 Wind Speed
Symptom: No wind speed
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Pulse channel specified by the Pulse
count instruction.
2. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohm meter to check
the coil. The resistance between the red and black wires should be about 2075
ohms. Infinite resistance indicates an open coil; low resistance indicates a
shorted coil.
3. Verify that the Configuration Code, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for
the Pulse Count instruction are correct for the datalogger type.
Symptom: Wind speed does not change
1. For the dataloggers that are programmed with Edlog, the input location for
wind speed is not updated if the datalogger is getting “Program Table
Overruns.” Increase the execution interval (scan rate) to prevent overruns.

Model 18802 Anemometer Drive provides a convenient and accurate way to rotate an anemometer shaft at 
a known rate. The motor may be set to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise at any rate between 200 and 
15,000 RPM in 100 RPM increments. The LCD display is referenced to an accurate and stable quartz timebase. 
For completely portable operation, the unit can be operated on internal batteries. For extended operation, an 
AC wall adapter is included.
Model 18811 Anemometer Drive is identical to Model 18802 except the drive motor incorporates a 
gear reducer for operation in the range of 20 to 990 RPM in 10 RPM increments. The lower range 
is recommended for cup anemometer calibration.
Model 18112 Vane Angle Bench Stand is used for benchtop wind direction calibration of the Wind Monitor 
family of sensors. The mounting post engages the direction orientation notch on the Wind Monitor. An easy to 
read pointer indicates 0 to 360 degrees with 1/2 degree resolution.
Model 18212 Vane Angle Fixture - Tower Mount similar to the Model 18112, the tower mount feature allows use 
on the tower as well as the bench top. The fixture is temporarily placed on the tower between the Wind Monitor 
and its tower mounting. Index keys and notches are engaged to preserve direction reference.
Model 18310 Propeller Torque Disc checks anemometer bearing torque with 0.1 gm/cm resolu-
tion. The disc temporarily replaces the propeller for torque measurement or simple yet accurate pass/fail 
checks. Charts included with the unit relate torque to propeller threshold with limits for acceptable 
bearing performance.
Model 18312 Cup-Wheel Torque Disc checks cup anemometer bearing torque.
Model 18331 Vane Torque Gauge checks vane bearing torque of the Wind Monitor family sensors. Slip the 
fixture over the main housing and make simple yet accurate vane torque measurements. Charts relating vane 
torque to vane threshold provide limits for acceptable bearing performance.
Model 18301 Vane Alignment Rod helps align the vane of a wind sensor to a known direction reference during 
installation. The base of the device has an index key that engages the direction orientation notch in the sensor 
allowing the sensor to be removed without losing wind direction reference.

  Query: Vaisala HMP155 operational temperature range accuracy response characteristics
  Dataset: sensor_knowledge
  Node Sets: temperature_humidity_sensor
  Results: 2
  
  Document Chunks:
    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed
every yea

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
Vaisala HUMICAPâ Humidity and Temperature Probe
HMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature
measurement. It is designed especially for demanding
outdoor applications.

  Dataset: maintenance_knowledge

  Document Chunks:
    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed
every yea

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.

  Document Chunks:
    1. R.M. Young Wind Monitor maintenance
Preventive maintenance for R.M. Young Wind Monitor includes:

-Checking the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer at least every second year. If the bearings are noisy or wind speed threshold increases above an acceptable level, replace the bearings.
After replacing the bearings, update the maintenance information in the Web UI.
-If the sensor measurement data looks suspicious after the maintenance operation, recalibrate the sensor.
R.M. Young suggests that the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer be
inspected at least every 24 months. Only a qualified technician should perform
the replacement.
Troubleshooting
7.1 Wind Direction
Symptom: -9999 or no change in direction
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Excitation and Single-Ended channel
specified by the measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the excitation voltage and Range code are correct for the
datalogger type.
3. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohn meter to check the
potentiometer. Resistance should be about 10K ohms between the Blue and
White wires. The resistance between either the Blue/Green or White/Green
wires should vary between 1K to 11K depending on the vane position.
Resistance when the vane is in the 5 degree dead band should be about 1 M
ohm.
Symptom: Incorrect wind direction
1. Verify that the Excitation voltage, Range code, multiplier and offset
parameters are correct for the datalogger type.
2. Check orientation of sensor, as described in Section 3.
7.2 Wind Speed
Symptom: No wind speed
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Pulse channel specified by the Pulse
count instruction.
2. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohm meter to check
the coil. The resistance between the red and black wires should be about 2075
ohms. Infinite resistance indicates an open coil; low resistance indicates a
shorted coil.
3. Verify that the Configuration Code, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for
the Pulse Count instruction are correct for the datalogger type.
Symptom: Wind speed does not change
1. For the dataloggers that are programmed with Edlog, the input location for
wind speed is not updated if the datalogger is getting “Program Table
Overruns.” Increase the execution interval (scan rate) to prevent overruns.

Query #8:
  Query: Vaisala HMP155 abrupt temperature spikes maintenance troubleshooting
  Dataset: maintenance_knowledge
  Node Sets: temperature_humidity_sensor
  Results: 2
  
  Document Chunks:
    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed
every yea

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
Vaisala HUMICAPâ Humidity and Temperature Probe
HMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature
measurement. It is designed especially for demanding
outdoor applications.

WIND MONITOR
MODEL 05103

Page 2:
Page 1
05103-90(N)
INTRODUCTION
The Wind Monitor measures horizontal wind speed and direction.  
Originally developed for ocean data buoy use, it is rugged and 
corrosion resistant yet accurate and light weight. The main housing, 
nose cone, propeller, and other internal parts are injection molded 
U.V. stabilized plastic. Both the propeller and vertical shafts use 
stainless steel precision grade ball bearings.  Bearings have light 
contacting teflon seals and are filled with a wide temperature range 
grease to help exclude contamination and moisture.
Propeller rotation produces an AC sine wave signal with frequency 
proportional to wind speed. This AC signal is induced in a 
stationary coil by a six pole magnet mounted on the propeller 
shaft. Three complete sine wave cycles are produced for each 
propeller revolution.
Vane position is transmitted by a 10K ohm precision conductive 
plastic potentiometer which requires a regulated excitation 
voltage. With a constant voltage applied to the potentiometer, 
the output signal is an analog voltage directly proportional to 
wind  direction angle.
The instrument mounts on standard one inch pipe, outside diameter 
34 mm (1.34"). An orientation ring is provided so the instrument 
can be removed for maintenance and reinstalled without loss of 
wind direction reference. Both the mounting post assembly and 
the orientation ring are secured to the mounting pipe by stainless 
steel band clamps. Electrical connections are made in a junction 
box at the base. A variety of devices are available for signal 
conditioning, display, and recording of wind speed and direction.  
INITIAL CHECKOUT
When the Wind Monitor is unpacked it should be checked carefully 
for any signs of shipping damage.  
Remove the plastic nut on the propeller shaft. Install the propeller 
on the shaft so the serial number on the propeller faces forward 
(into the wind). Engage the propeller into the molded ribs on the 
propeller shaft hub. The instrument is aligned, balanced and fully 
calibrated before shipment, however, it should be checked both 
mechanically and electrically before installation. The vane and 
propeller should easily rotate 360° without friction. Check vane 
balance by holding the instrument base so the vane surface is 
horizontal. It should have near neutral torque without any particular 
tendency to rotate. A slight imbalance will not degrade performance.
The potentiometer requires a stable DC excitation voltage.  Do 
not exceed 15 volts. When the potentiometer wiper is in the 5° 
deadband region, the output signal is "floating" and may show 
varying or unpredictable values. To prevent false readings,  signal 
conditioning electronics should clamp the signal to excitation 
or reference level when this occurs. NOTE: Young signal 
conditioning devices clamp the signal to excitation level. Avoid 
a short circuit between the wind direction signal line and either the 
excitation or reference lines. Although there is a 1K ohm current 
limiting resistor in series with the wiper for protection, damage 
to the potentiometer may occur if a short circuit condition exists.
Before installation, connect the instrument to an indicator as shown 
in the wiring diagram and check for proper wind speed and wind 
direction values. To check wind speed, temporarily remove the 
propeller and connect the shaft to an Anemometer Drive. Details 
appear in the CALIBRATION section of this manual.

INSTALLATION
Proper placement of the instrument is very important. Eddies from 
trees, buildings, or other structures can greatly influence wind 
speed and wind direction observations. To get meaningful data 
for most applications locate the instrument well above or upwind 
from obstructions. As a general rule, the air flow around a structure 
is disturbed to twice the height of the structure upwind, six times 
the height downwind, and up to twice the height of the structure 
above ground. For some applications it may not be practical or 
necessary to meet these requirements.
FAILURE TO PROPERLY GROUND THE WIND MONITOR  
MAY RESULT IN ERRONEOUS SIGNALS  
OR TRANSDUCER DAMAGE.
Grounding the Wind Monitor is vitally important. Without proper 
grounding, static electrical charge can build up during certain 
atmospheric conditions and discharge through the transducers. 
This discharge can cause erroneous signals or transducer failure. 
To direct the discharge away from the transducers, the mounting 
post assembly is made with a special antistatic plastic. It is very 
important that the mounting post be connected to a good earth 
ground. There are two ways this may be accomplished. First, 
the Wind Monitor may be mounted on a metal pipe which is 
connected to earth ground. The mounting pipe should not be 
painted where the Wind Monitor is mounted. Towers or masts 
set in concrete should be connected to one or more grounding 
rods. If it is difficult to ground the mounting post in this manner, 
the following method should be used. Inside the junction box 
the terminal labeled EARTH GND is internally connected to the 
antistatic mounting post. This terminal should be connected to 
an earth ground (Refer to wiring diagram).
Initial installation is most easily done with two people; one to adjust 
the instrument position and the other to observe the indicating 
device. After initial installation, the instrument can be removed 
and returned to its mounting without realigning the vane since 
the orientation ring preserves the wind direction reference. Install 
the Wind Monitor following these steps:
1. MOUNT WIND MONITOR
 a) Place orientation ring on mounting post. Do Not tighten 
band clamp yet.
 b) Place Wind Monitor on mounting post. Do Not tighten 
band clamp yet. 
  
2. CONNECT SENSOR CABLE
 a) Refer to wiring diagram located at back of manual.
 
3. ALIGN VANE
 a) Connect instrument to an indicator.
 b) Choose a known wind direction reference point on the 
horizon.
 c) Sighting down instrument centerline, point nose cone at  
reference point on horizon.
 d) While holding vane in position, slowly turn base until 
indicator shows proper value.
 e) Tighten mounting post band clamp.
 f) Engage orientation ring indexing pin in notch at 
instrument base.
 g) Tighten orientation ring band clamp.
CALIBRATION
The Wind Monitor is fully calibrated before shipment and should 
require no adjustments. Recalibration may be necessary after 
some maintenance operations. Periodic calibration checks are 
desirable and may be necessary where the instrument is used in 
programs which require auditing of sensor performance.
Accurate wind direction calibration requires a Model 18112 Vane 
Angle Bench Stand. Begin by connecting the instrument to a 
signal conditioning circuit which has some method of indicating 
wind direction value. This may be a display which shows wind 
direction values in angular degrees or simply a voltmeter 
monitoring the output. Orient the base so the junction box faces 
due south. Visually align the vane with the crossmarkings and 
observe the indicator output. If the vane position and indicator 
do not agree within 5°, adjust the potentiometer coupling inside 
the main housing. Details for making this adjustment appear 
in the MAINTENANCE, POTENTIOMETER REPLACEMENT, 
outline, step 7. 
It is important to note that, while the sensor mechanically rotates 
through 360°, the full scale wind direction signal from the signal 
conditioning occurs at 355°. The signal conditioning electronics 
must be adjusted accordingly. For example, in a circuit where 0 
to 1.000 VDC represents 0° to 360°, the output must be adjusted 
for 0.986 VDC when the instrument is at 355°. (355°/360° X 1.000 
volts = 0.986 volts)
Wind speed calibration is determined by propeller pitch and the 
output characteristics of the transducer. Calibration formulas 
showing wind speed vs. propeller rpm and output frequency are 
included below. Standard accuracy is ± 0.3 m/s (0.6mph). For 
greater accuracy, the sensor must be individually calibrated in 
comparison with a wind speed standard. Contact the factory or 
your supplier to schedule a NIST (National Institute of Standards 
& Technology) traceable wind tunnel calibration in our facility.
 
To calibrate wind system electronics using a signal from the 
instrument, temporarily remove the propeller and connect an 
Anemometer Drive (18802 or equivalent)  to the propeller shaft. 
Apply the appropriate calibration formula to the calibrating motor 
rpm and adjust the electronics for the proper value. For example, 
with the propeller shaft turning at 3600 rpm, adjust an indicator to 
display 17.6 meters per second [3600 rpm  X 0.00490 (m/s)/rpm 
=17.6 m/s]
Details on checking bearing torque, which affects wind speed and 
direction threshold, appear in the following section.

MAINTENANCE
Given proper care, the Wind Monitor should provide years of 
service. The only components likely to need replacement due to 
normal wear are the precision ball bearings and the wind direction 
potentiometer. Only a qualified instrument technician should 
perform the replacement. If service facilities are not available, 
return the instrument to the company. Refer to the drawings to 
become familiar with part names and locations. The asterisk * 
which appears in the following outlines is a reminder that maximum 
torque on all set screws is 80 oz-in.
POTENTIOMETER REPLACEMENT
The potentiometer has a life expectancy of fifty million revolutions. 
As it becomes worn, the element may begin to produce noisy 
signals or become nonlinear. When signal noise or non-linearity 
becomes unacceptable, replace the potentiometer. Refer to 
exploded view drawing and proceed as follows:
1. REMOVE MAIN HOUSING
 a) Unscrew nose cone from main housing. Set o-ring aside 
for later use.
 b) Gently push main housing latch.
 c) While pushing latch, lift main housing up and remove it 
from vertical shaft bearing rotor.
2. UNSOLDER TRANSDUCER WIRE
 a) Remove junction box cover, exposing circuit board.
 b) Remove screws holding circuit board.
 c) Unsolder three potentiometer wires (white, green, black), two 
wind speed coil wires (red, black) and earth ground wire (red) 
from board.
3. REMOVE POTENTIOMETER
 a) Loosen set screw on potentiometer coupling and remove 
it from potentiometer adjust thumbwheel.
 b) Loosen set screw on potentiometer adjust thumbwheel 
and remove it from potentiometer shaft.

and remove assembly from vertical shaft.
 d) Unscrew potentiometer housing from potentiometer 
  mounting & coil assembly.
 e) Push potentiometer out of potentiometer mounting & 
coil assembly by applying firm but gentle pressure on 
potentiometer shaft. Make sure that the shaft o-ring 
comes out with the potentiometer.  If not, then gently 
push it out from the top of the coil assembly.
4. INSTALL NEW  POTENTIOMETER
 a) Push new potentiometer into potentiometer mounting & 
coil assembly making sure o-ring is on shaft.
 b) Feed potentiometer and coil wires through hole in bottom 
of potentiometer housing.
 c) Screw potentiometer housing onto potentiometer 
mounting & coil assembly.
 d) Gently pull transducer wires through bottom of 
  potentiometer housing to take up any slack. Apply a 
small amount of silicone sealant around hole.
 e) Install transducer assembly on vertical shaft allowing  
0.5 mm (0.020") clearance from vertical bearing.  
Tighten set screws* at bottom of transducer assembly.
 f) Place potentiometer adjust thumbwheel on potentiometer 
shaft and tighten set screw*.
 g) Place potentiometer coupling on potentiometer
   adjust thumbwheel. Do Not tighten set screw yet.

    1. R.M. Young Wind Monitor maintenance
Preventive maintenance for R.M. Young Wind Monitor includes:

-Checking the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer at least every second year. If the bearings are noisy or wind speed threshold increases above an acceptable level, replace the bearings.
After replacing the bearings, update the maintenance information in the Web UI.
-If the sensor measurement data looks suspicious after the maintenance operation, recalibrate the sensor.
R.M. Young suggests that the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer be
inspected at least every 24 months. Only a qualified technician should perform
the replacement.
Troubleshooting
7.1 Wind Direction
Symptom: -9999 or no change in direction
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Excitation and Single-Ended channel
specified by the measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the excitation voltage and Range code are correct for the
datalogger type.
3. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohn meter to check the
potentiometer. Resistance should be about 10K ohms between the Blue and
White wires. The resistance between either the Blue/Green or White/Green
wires should vary between 1K to 11K depending on the vane position.
Resistance when the vane is in the 5 degree dead band should be about 1 M
ohm.
Symptom: Incorrect wind direction
1. Verify that the Excitation voltage, Range code, multiplier and offset
parameters are correct for the datalogger type.
2. Check orientation of sensor, as described in Section 3.
7.2 Wind Speed
Symptom: No wind speed
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Pulse channel specified by the Pulse
count instruction.
2. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohm meter to check
the coil. The resistance between the red and black wires should be about 2075
ohms. Infinite resistance indicates an open coil; low resistance indicates a
shorted coil.
3. Verify that the Configuration Code, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for
the Pulse Count instruction are correct for the datalogger type.
Symptom: Wind speed does not change
1. For the dataloggers that are programmed with Edlog, the input location for
wind speed is not updated if the datalogger is getting “Program Table
Overruns.” Increase the execution interval (scan rate) to prevent overruns.

Model 18802 Anemometer Drive provides a convenient and accurate way to rotate an anemometer shaft at 
a known rate. The motor may be set to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise at any rate between 200 and 
15,000 RPM in 100 RPM increments. The LCD display is referenced to an accurate and stable quartz timebase. 
For completely portable operation, the unit can be operated on internal batteries. For extended operation, an 
AC wall adapter is included.
Model 18811 Anemometer Drive is identical to Model 18802 except the drive motor incorporates a 
gear reducer for operation in the range of 20 to 990 RPM in 10 RPM increments. The lower range 
is recommended for cup anemometer calibration.
Model 18112 Vane Angle Bench Stand is used for benchtop wind direction calibration of the Wind Monitor 
family of sensors. The mounting post engages the direction orientation notch on the Wind Monitor. An easy to 
read pointer indicates 0 to 360 degrees with 1/2 degree resolution.
Model 18212 Vane Angle Fixture - Tower Mount similar to the Model 18112, the tower mount feature allows use 
on the tower as well as the bench top. The fixture is temporarily placed on the tower between the Wind Monitor 
and its tower mounting. Index keys and notches are engaged to preserve direction reference.
Model 18310 Propeller Torque Disc checks anemometer bearing torque with 0.1 gm/cm resolu-
tion. The disc temporarily replaces the propeller for torque measurement or simple yet accurate pass/fail 
checks. Charts included with the unit relate torque to propeller threshold with limits for acceptable 
bearing performance.
Model 18312 Cup-Wheel Torque Disc checks cup anemometer bearing torque.
Model 18331 Vane Torque Gauge checks vane bearing torque of the Wind Monitor family sensors. Slip the 
fixture over the main housing and make simple yet accurate vane torque measurements. Charts relating vane 
torque to vane threshold provide limits for acceptable bearing performance.
Model 18301 Vane Alignment Rod helps align the vane of a wind sensor to a known direction reference during 
installation. The base of the device has an index key that engages the direction orientation notch in the sensor 
allowing the sensor to be removed without losing wind direction reference.
Specifications subject to change without notice.

Query #12:
  Query: Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor operational ranges sensitivity technical specifications
  Dataset: sensor_knowledge
  Node Sets: temperature_humidity_sensor
  Results: 2
  
  Document Chunks:
    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed
every yea

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
Vaisala HUMICAPâ Humidity and Temperature Probe
HMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature
measurement. It is designed especially for demanding
outdoor applications.

Query #13:
  Query: maintenance and troubleshooting for Young 05103-L wind direction sensor and Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor anomalies
  Dataset: maintenance_knowledge
  Node Sets: wind_sensor, temperature_humidity_sensor
  Results: 2
  
  Document Chunks:
    1. R.M. Young Wind Monitor maintenance
Preventive maintenance for R.M. Young Wind Monitor includes:

-Checking the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer at least every second year. If the bearings are noisy or wind speed threshold increases above an acceptable level, replace the bearings.
After replacing the bearings, update the maintenance information in the Web UI.
-If the sensor measurement data looks suspicious after the maintenance operation, recalibrate the sensor.
R.M. Young suggests that the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer be
inspected at least every 24 months. Only a qualified technician should perform
the replacement.
Troubleshooting
7.1 Wind Direction
Symptom: -9999 or no change in direction
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Excitation and Single-Ended channel
specified by the measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the excitation voltage and Range code are correct for the
datalogger type.
3. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohn meter to check the
potentiometer. Resistance should be about 10K ohms between the Blue and
White wires. The resistance between either the Blue/Green or White/Green
wires should vary between 1K to 11K depending on the vane position.
Resistance when the vane is in the 5 degree dead band should be about 1 M
ohm.
Symptom: Incorrect wind direction
1. Verify that the Excitation voltage, Range code, multiplier and offset
parameters are correct for the datalogger type.
2. Check orientation of sensor, as described in Section 3.
7.2 Wind Speed
Symptom: No wind speed
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Pulse channel specified by the Pulse
count instruction.
2. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohm meter to check
the coil. The resistance between the red and black wires should be about 2075
ohms. Infinite resistance indicates an open coil; low resistance indicates a
shorted coil.
3. Verify that the Configuration Code, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for
the Pulse Count instruction are correct for the datalogger type.
Symptom: Wind speed does not change
1. For the dataloggers that are programmed with Edlog, the input location for
wind speed is not updated if the datalogger is getting “Program Table
Overruns.” Increase the execution interval (scan rate) to prevent overruns.
