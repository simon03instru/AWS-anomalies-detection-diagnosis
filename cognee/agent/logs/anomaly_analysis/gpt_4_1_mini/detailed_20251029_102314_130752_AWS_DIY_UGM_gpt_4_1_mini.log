[32mResponse from Worker node 42b0c738-c5cc-42ff-9e4b-f5815d4093a9 (Weather data analysis):[39m

[32mThe weather data for UGM Yogyakarta, Indonesia on August 15, 2024, around 20:00 UTC shows no precipitation recorded in the hour surrounding the event time, with precipitation values consistently at 0.0 mm. Surface pressure remained stable around 994.9 to 995.0 hPa, and temperature was steady around 20.5°C. These conditions strongly contrast with the reported rainfall anomaly of 100 mm in 10 minutes, which is not supported by the satellite-based weather data. The lack of any pressure drop or temperature change further supports the assessment that the rainfall sensor reading was a spurious spike likely due to sensor malfunction. Therefore, the anomaly is not corroborated by actual weather conditions, indicating a sensor fault rather than a real weather event.[39m

[32mAfter reviewing the available data and the initial anomaly report for the AWS_DIY_UGM station, there is only one confirmed anomaly detected, which is the rainfall sensor reporting 100 mm in a 10-minute interval. This anomaly is highly likely due to a sensor malfunction, as the satellite-based weather data for the same period shows no precipitation, stable surface pressure around 995 hPa, and steady temperature around 20.5°C. There are no other anomalies detected in parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, or pressure. Therefore, no multiple anomalies exist to analyze for correlations or common causes. The single anomaly is best explained as a spurious sensor fault, and maintenance or sensor troubleshooting is recommended to address this issue.[39m

[32mThe HYQUEST TB4 rainfall sensor has an operational range up to 700 mm per hour. Its accuracy varies with rainfall intensity: for 0-100 mm per hour, accuracy is better than +/-2%, and for higher intensities up to 300 mm per hour, accuracy decreases but remains within +/-10%. Given this, a reported rainfall of 100 mm in 10 minutes corresponds to 600 mm per hour, which is within the sensor's maximum measurable range but at the high end of its range where accuracy is lower. Therefore, while the sensor can technically measure such a high rainfall rate, the reported value of 100 mm in 10 minutes is extreme and unusual, suggesting the possibility of sensor malfunction or anomaly, especially considering no concurrent environmental changes were observed.[39m

[32mResponse from Worker node 42b0c738-c5cc-42ff-9e4b-f5815d4093a9 (Weather data analysis):[39m

[32mThe rainfall anomaly reported at AWS_DIY_UGM station on 2024-08-15T20:00:00, showing 100 mm in 10 minutes, is highly likely a sensor malfunction. Satellite-based weather data for the location and time show no precipitation, with values consistently at 0.0 mm in the hour surrounding the event. Surface pressure remained stable around 995 hPa, and temperature was steady around 20.5°C, with no environmental changes supporting heavy rainfall. The HYQUEST TB4 sensor used has an operational range up to 700 mm per hour and can technically measure such high rainfall, but the reported value is extreme and unusual, especially without corroborating weather conditions.

Common causes for such spurious rainfall spikes include debris obstruction, electrical interference, and mechanical failures in the tipping bucket mechanism. Recommended maintenance actions include:
1. Verify and clean the sensor's catch filter, siphon, bucket interior, screws, and insect screens to remove any debris.
2. Inspect wiring and electrical connections for damage or wear and ensure proper configuration.
3. Test the tipping mechanism for smooth operation and check data logger tip recording.
4. Perform functional tests and calibrations using a Portable Field Calibration Device (FCD) to ensure accuracy.

Data validation should include cross-checking sensor data with nearby stations or satellite data to identify anomalies early. Regular maintenance and calibration schedules should be established to minimize sensor faults and ensure reliable rainfall measurements.[39m

FINAL OUTPUT - SYNTHESIZED RESULT
================================================================================
--- Subtask 5c083877-c5f1-4a82-b431-9c1154b8d4be.1 Result ---
The weather data for UGM Yogyakarta, Indonesia on August 15, 2024, around 20:00 UTC shows no precipitation recorded in the hour surrounding the event time, with precipitation values consistently at 0.0 mm. Surface pressure remained stable around 994.9 to 995.0 hPa, and temperature was steady around 20.5°C. These conditions strongly contrast with the reported rainfall anomaly of 100 mm in 10 minutes, which is not supported by the satellite-based weather data. The lack of any pressure drop or temperature change further supports the assessment that the rainfall sensor reading was a spurious spike likely due to sensor malfunction. Therefore, the anomaly is not corroborated by actual weather conditions, indicating a sensor fault rather than a real weather event.

--- Subtask 5c083877-c5f1-4a82-b431-9c1154b8d4be.2 Result ---
The HYQUEST TB4 rainfall sensor has an operational range up to 700 mm per hour. Its accuracy varies with rainfall intensity: for 0-100 mm per hour, accuracy is better than +/-2%, and for higher intensities up to 300 mm per hour, accuracy decreases but remains within +/-10%. Given this, a reported rainfall of 100 mm in 10 minutes corresponds to 600 mm per hour, which is within the sensor's maximum measurable range but at the high end of its range where accuracy is lower. Therefore, while the sensor can technically measure such a high rainfall rate, the reported value of 100 mm in 10 minutes is extreme and unusual, suggesting the possibility of sensor malfunction or anomaly, especially considering no concurrent environmental changes were observed.

--- Subtask 5c083877-c5f1-4a82-b431-9c1154b8d4be.3 Result ---
Troubleshooting guides for the HYQUEST TB4 rainfall sensor include checking wiring to the pulse/control terminal, verifying configuration parameters, and testing switch continuity. Common failure modes involve tipping mechanism blockage or dirt and electrical connection failures. Maintenance procedures recommend regular cleaning of the catch filter, siphon, bucket interior, screws, and insect screens, as well as checking the tipping assembly movement and data logger tip recording. Causes for spurious rainfall spikes include debris obstruction (e.g., leaves, bird droppings), electrical interference, and mechanical failures within the tipping bucket mechanism. Recommended maintenance actions are to regularly clean the finger filter and collector area, inspect electrical connections and cables for damage or wear, and perform periodic functional tests and calibrations using a Portable Field Calibration Device (FCD) to ensure accurate measurements and minimize downtime.

--- Subtask 5c083877-c5f1-4a82-b431-9c1154b8d4be.5 Result ---
After reviewing the available data and the initial anomaly report for the AWS_DIY_UGM station, there is only one confirmed anomaly detected, which is the rainfall sensor reporting 100 mm in a 10-minute interval. This anomaly is highly likely due to a sensor malfunction, as the satellite-based weather data for the same period shows no precipitation, stable surface pressure around 995 hPa, and steady temperature around 20.5°C. There are no other anomalies detected in parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, or pressure. Therefore, no multiple anomalies exist to analyze for correlations or common causes. The single anomaly is best explained as a spurious sensor fault, and maintenance or sensor troubleshooting is recommended to address this issue.

    1. TIPPING BUCKET TAINGAUGE MODEL TB4 HYQUEST Solutions

The only routine maintenance required is cleaning. The following items should be checked
regularly for cleanliness:
 Catch filter
 Syphon (refer diagram 2)
 Interior of bucket
 Top surface of adjusting screws
 Enclosure locking screws - lightly lubricate after cleaning
 All insect screens


ELECTRICAL
Dual reed switches are provided for several reasons:
 Two isolated switches permit the control of two separate circuits; e.g. a local counter
and a telemetry circuit.
 Parallel connection of both switches increases the current carrying capacity of the
contact system if required.
 Parallel switch operation confers a degree of redundancy in locations where data from
the raingauge is critical to flood warning etc.

CALIBRATION
All gauges have been calibrated by Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd, prior to despatch.
The following products and services are available from Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd:
 Field Calibration Device, Model TB320, for routine field check calibrations,
supplied with operating instruction sheet refers to page FCD 110-01.
 Laboratory Calibration Unit, Model TB340, for calibration after servicing in
workshops, supplied with operating manual.
 Recalibration Service at Hyquest Solutions’ factory.
Please contact either Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd or our local distributor for further
information.


Troubleshooting
Symptom: No precipitation measurement
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count
instruction.
2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the
PulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.
Disconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check
of the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket
between the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket
is tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.
Symptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12
1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and
Table 7-3 [p. 10]).

Maintenance
During each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,
debris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.
Verify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket
tip.
Dismantling for cleaning
Regularly check the following items for cleanliness:
l Catch filter
l Siphon
l Interior of bucket
l Top surface of adjusting screws
l Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning
l Insect screens
To access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and
lifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).

2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base
Separate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the
siphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.

Disassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):
a. Unscrew nut
b. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body
c. Remove stem from siphon body
d. Unscrew cap
e. Clean all items

Reassembling the rain bucket
1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Push stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Replace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
CAUTION:
Do not over tighten.
Push filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.
5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure
the housing onto the base.

Calibration check
The sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the
adjustment screws have loosened.
Nevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting
upward on the housing.
2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.
3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated
cylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection
funnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).
4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39
times.
5. If the rain gage fails to record the correct number of tips, return the unit to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration (see Assistance at the back of this manual).

General Description
HyQuest Solutions’ TB6 is a non-syphoning 
high-quality tipping bucket rain gauge for 
measuring rainfall and precipitation in urban 
and rural locations. The TB6 is the device of 
choice for accurately measuring low rainfall 
events (0-50 mm/hr with better than +/-1 % 
accuracy), because the water passes through 
the nozzle and enters the bucket directly al-
lowing small rainfall events to be measured. 
The TB6’s tried and proven design ensures 
long-term, accurate and repeatable results. 
It is manufactured from high quality, dura-
ble materials ensuring long term stability in 
the harshest of environments. It consists of 
a robust powder-coated aluminium enclo-
sure, a UV-resistant ASA polymer base, and 
stainless steel fasteners and ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter. 
Easy maintenance
Removal of the outer enclosure and access 
to the tipping bucket mechanism and ﬁ  nger 
ﬁ  lter assembly is made easy with quick 
release fasteners. The ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter can be 
removed easily during a ﬁ  eld service. It 
ensures the collector catch area remains 
unblocked when leaves, bird droppings and 
other debris ﬁ  nd their way into the catch.
The TB6’s base incorporates two water 
outlets at the bottom allowing for wa-
ter collection and data veriﬁ  cation.
Output options
TB6 includes a dual output 24 V DC 
reed switch allowing for output redun-
dancy or the addition of a second data

    1. TIPPING BUCKET TAINGAUGE MODEL TB4 HYQUEST Solutions

The only routine maintenance required is cleaning. The following items should be checked
regularly for cleanliness:
 Catch filter
 Syphon (refer diagram 2)
 Interior of bucket
 Top surface of adjusting screws
 Enclosure locking screws - lightly lubricate after cleaning
 All insect screens


ELECTRICAL
Dual reed switches are provided for several reasons:
 Two isolated switches permit the control of two separate circuits; e.g. a local counter
and a telemetry circuit.
 Parallel connection of both switches increases the current carrying capacity of the
contact system if required.
 Parallel switch operation confers a degree of redundancy in locations where data from
the raingauge is critical to flood warning etc.

CALIBRATION
All gauges have been calibrated by Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd, prior to despatch.
The following products and services are available from Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd:
 Field Calibration Device, Model TB320, for routine field check calibrations,
supplied with operating instruction sheet refers to page FCD 110-01.
 Laboratory Calibration Unit, Model TB340, for calibration after servicing in
workshops, supplied with operating manual.
 Recalibration Service at Hyquest Solutions’ factory.
Please contact either Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd or our local distributor for further
information.


Troubleshooting
Symptom: No precipitation measurement
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count
instruction.
2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the
PulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.
Disconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check
of the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket
between the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket
is tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.
Symptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12
1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and
Table 7-3 [p. 10]).

Maintenance
During each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,
debris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.
Verify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket
tip.
Dismantling for cleaning
Regularly check the following items for cleanliness:
l Catch filter
l Siphon
l Interior of bucket
l Top surface of adjusting screws
l Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning
l Insect screens
To access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and
lifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).

2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base
Separate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the
siphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.

Disassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):
a. Unscrew nut
b. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body
c. Remove stem from siphon body
d. Unscrew cap
e. Clean all items

Reassembling the rain bucket
1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Push stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Replace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
CAUTION:
Do not over tighten.
Push filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.
5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure
the housing onto the base.

Calibration check
The sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the
adjustment screws have loosened.
Nevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting
upward on the housing.
2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.
3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated
cylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection
funnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).
4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39
times.
5. If the rain gage fails to record the correct number of tips, return the unit to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration (see Assistance at the back of this manual).

General Description
HyQuest Solutions’ TB6 is a non-syphoning 
high-quality tipping bucket rain gauge for 
measuring rainfall and precipitation in urban 
and rural locations. The TB6 is the device of 
choice for accurately measuring low rainfall 
events (0-50 mm/hr with better than +/-1 % 
accuracy), because the water passes through 
the nozzle and enters the bucket directly al-
lowing small rainfall events to be measured. 
The TB6’s tried and proven design ensures 
long-term, accurate and repeatable results. 
It is manufactured from high quality, dura-
ble materials ensuring long term stability in 
the harshest of environments. It consists of 
a robust powder-coated aluminium enclo-
sure, a UV-resistant ASA polymer base, and 
stainless steel fasteners and ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter. 
Easy maintenance
Removal of the outer enclosure and access 
to the tipping bucket mechanism and ﬁ  nger 
ﬁ  lter assembly is made easy with quick 
release fasteners. The ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter can be 
removed easily during a ﬁ  eld service. It 
ensures the collector catch area remains 
unblocked when leaves, bird droppings and 
other debris ﬁ  nd their way into the catch.
The TB6’s base incorporates two water 
outlets at the bottom allowing for wa-
ter collection and data veriﬁ  cation.
Output options
TB6 includes a dual output 24 V DC 
reed switch allowing for output redun-
dancy or the addition of a second data 
logger. The second output could also be 
used for connecting HyQuest Solutions’ 
current meter counter CMCbt paired 
with the free FCD application that allow 
for easy and accurate ﬁ  eld calibration 
even in noisy (urban) environments. The 
reed switch incorporates varistor protection 
against surges that may be induced on long, 
inappropriately shielded signal cables.
Main Features
  Standard 200 mm diameter catch
  Long term stable calibration
  Minimal maintenance required
  Robust design for all environments

    1. TIPPING BUCKET TAINGAUGE MODEL TB4 HYQUEST Solutions

The only routine maintenance required is cleaning. The following items should be checked
regularly for cleanliness:
 Catch filter
 Syphon (refer diagram 2)
 Interior of bucket
 Top surface of adjusting screws
 Enclosure locking screws - lightly lubricate after cleaning
 All insect screens


ELECTRICAL
Dual reed switches are provided for several reasons:
 Two isolated switches permit the control of two separate circuits; e.g. a local counter
and a telemetry circuit.
 Parallel connection of both switches increases the current carrying capacity of the
contact system if required.
 Parallel switch operation confers a degree of redundancy in locations where data from
the raingauge is critical to flood warning etc.

CALIBRATION
All gauges have been calibrated by Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd, prior to despatch.
The following products and services are available from Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd:
 Field Calibration Device, Model TB320, for routine field check calibrations,
supplied with operating instruction sheet refers to page FCD 110-01.
 Laboratory Calibration Unit, Model TB340, for calibration after servicing in
workshops, supplied with operating manual.
 Recalibration Service at Hyquest Solutions’ factory.
Please contact either Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd or our local distributor for further
information.


Troubleshooting
Symptom: No precipitation measurement
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count
instruction.
2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the
PulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.
Disconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check
of the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket
between the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket
is tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.
Symptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12
1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and
Table 7-3 [p. 10]).

Maintenance
During each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,
debris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.
Verify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket
tip.
Dismantling for cleaning
Regularly check the following items for cleanliness:
l Catch filter
l Siphon
l Interior of bucket
l Top surface of adjusting screws
l Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning
l Insect screens
To access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and
lifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).

2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base
Separate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the
siphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.

Disassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):
a. Unscrew nut
b. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body
c. Remove stem from siphon body
d. Unscrew cap
e. Clean all items

Reassembling the rain bucket
1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Push stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Replace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
CAUTION:
Do not over tighten.
Push filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.
5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure
the housing onto the base.

Calibration check
The sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the
adjustment screws have loosened.
Nevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting
upward on the housing.
2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.
3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated
cylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection
funnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).
4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39
times.
5. If the rain gage fails to record the correct number of tips, return the unit to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration (see Assistance at the back of this manual).

General Description
HyQuest Solutions’ TB6 is a non-syphoning 
high-quality tipping bucket rain gauge for 
measuring rainfall and precipitation in urban 
and rural locations. The TB6 is the device of 
choice for accurately measuring low rainfall 
events (0-50 mm/hr with better than +/-1 % 
accuracy), because the water passes through 
the nozzle and enters the bucket directly al-
lowing small rainfall events to be measured. 
The TB6’s tried and proven design ensures 
long-term, accurate and repeatable results. 
It is manufactured from high quality, dura-
ble materials ensuring long term stability in 
the harshest of environments. It consists of 
a robust powder-coated aluminium enclo-
sure, a UV-resistant ASA polymer base, and 
stainless steel fasteners and ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter. 
Easy maintenance
Removal of the outer enclosure and access 
to the tipping bucket mechanism and ﬁ  nger 
ﬁ  lter assembly is made easy with quick 
release fasteners. The ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter can be 
removed easily during a ﬁ  eld service. It 
ensures the collector catch area remains 
unblocked when leaves, bird droppings and 
other debris ﬁ  nd their way into the catch.
The TB6’s base incorporates two water 
outlets at the bottom allowing for wa-
ter collection and data veriﬁ  cation.
Output options
TB6 includes a dual output 24 V DC 
reed switch allowing for output redun-
dancy or the addition of a second data 
logger. The second output could also be 
used for connecting HyQuest Solutions’ 
current meter counter CMCbt paired 
with the free FCD application that allow 
for easy and accurate ﬁ  eld calibration 
even in noisy (urban) environments. The 
reed switch incorporates varistor protection 
against surges that may be induced on long, 
inappropriately shielded signal cables.
Main Features
  Standard 200 mm diameter catch
  Long term stable calibration
  Minimal maintenance required
  Robust design for all environments
  Optional: autonomous real-time rain 
monitoring and reporting system
