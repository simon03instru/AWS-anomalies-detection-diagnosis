[32mThe weather data for Cibubur, Indonesia around August 16, 2024 at 22:30 local time (15:30 UTC) shows a typical temperature of about 12.1°C and zero direct solar radiation. Compared to the anomalous readings of 2.96°C temperature and 1000 W/m² solar radiation, the actual temperature is significantly higher and the solar radiation is expectedly zero at night. This confirms that the anomalous temperature reading is unusually low by approximately 9.1°C and the solar radiation reading is physically impossible at that time, indicating sensor errors or faults. The typical conditions do not support the anomaly values, reinforcing the likelihood of sensor malfunction or calibration issues.[39m

[32mResponse from Worker node f7b99e69-aba0-4ee3-92a1-516c816d7a31 (Sensor specifications):[39m

[32mThe Kipp & Zonen CMP3 solar radiation sensor has an operational irradiance range of 0 to 1500 W/m² and a maximum operational irradiance of 2000 W/m². Its sensitivity ranges from 5 to 20 µV/W/m². The sensor operates within a temperature range of -40 °C to +80 °C and relative humidity from 0 to 100%. It has a response time of less than 6 seconds for 63% response and less than 12 seconds for 95% response. Regarding the reported solar radiation of 1000 W/m² at night, this value is within the sensor's operational range but physically unrealistic for night-time conditions, indicating a sensor fault or misreading rather than a valid measurement. The sensor sensitivity aligns with expected solar radiation trends, which should be near zero at night; thus, a high reading like 1000 W/m² at night does not correspond to normal night-time solar radiation trends. In conclusion, while the sensor's specifications support measuring up to 1500 W/m², the anomalous night-time reading of 1000 W/m² is not consistent with expected environmental conditions and suggests sensor malfunction or error. The sensor is suitable for solar radiation measurement within its range but requires maintenance or troubleshooting to address such anomalies.[39m

[32mComprehensive Assessment Report on Temperature and Solar Radiation Anomalies at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit on August 16, 2024 at 22:30

1. Summary of Anomalies:
- Temperature anomaly: Recorded temperature of 2.96°C is significantly lower than the expected night-time average of approximately 28°C for the location and time, representing a deviation of about 25°C (>3σ). This is far below the typical temperature of around 12.1°C observed at the same time.
- Solar radiation anomaly: Recorded solar radiation of 1000 W/m² at 22:30 local time (night) is physically impossible, as typical solar radiation at night is zero.

2. Sensor Specifications and Operational Range:
- Vaisala HMP155 Temperature Sensor: Operational range from -80°C to +60°C, with high sensitivity and accuracy suitable for detecting small temperature changes. The anomalous low temperature reading is within the sensor's operational range but inconsistent with environmental conditions, suggesting sensor fault or calibration error.
- Kipp & Zonen CMP3 Solar Radiation Sensor: Operational range up to 1500 W/m², capable of accurate solar radiation measurement. The 1000 W/m² reading at night is within sensor range but physically unrealistic, indicating sensor malfunction or misreading.

3. Likely Causes of Anomalies:
- Temperature sensor likely stuck at a low reading or suffering from calibration drift or error, possibly due to contamination, wiring issues, or sensor damage.
- Solar radiation sensor likely affected by sensor dome contamination (dew, frost, dirt), electrical faults, or calibration errors causing false high readings at night.

4. Potential Correlation or Common Causes:
- Both anomalies occurring simultaneously suggest a possible common cause such as environmental factors affecting sensor housings (e.g., moisture ingress, condensation), electrical issues (power supply or wiring faults), or data logger misconfiguration.
- Sensor maintenance neglect or environmental exposure could degrade both sensors concurrently.

5. Actionable Recommendations:
- For Vaisala HMP155 Temperature Sensor:
  * Verify wiring and power supply integrity.
  * Inspect and clean sensor tip and radiation shield.
  * Recalibrate sensor using appropriate calibration tools.
  * Check for condensation or moisture affecting sensor performance.
  * Replace sensor if calibration and cleaning do not resolve anomaly.

- For Kipp & Zonen CMP3 Solar Radiation Sensor:
  * Clean sensor dome regularly to remove dew, frost, dirt.
  * Inspect wiring and sensor cable for damage or shorts.
  * Verify calibration factors and recalibrate every two years.
  * Check for electromagnetic interference or improper installation.
  * Conduct performance tests to confirm sensor output consistency.

- General:
  * Review data logger settings and ensure correct sensor configuration.
  * Maintain a log of maintenance and calibration activities.
  * Consider environmental protection improvements for sensor housings.

6. Conclusion:
The temperature and solar radiation anomalies at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit on August 16, 2024 at 22:30 are caused by sensor malfunctions rather than actual environmental conditions. Both sensors are operationally suitable but likely suffer from calibration errors, contamination, or electrical faults. The simultaneous anomalies suggest common environmental or electrical causes. Prompt maintenance, cleaning, recalibration, and inspection are recommended to restore accurate sensor performance and prevent recurrence.[39m

FINAL OUTPUT - SYNTHESIZED RESULT
================================================================================
--- Subtask b2308c7a-2173-4a4e-9325-85606ee3d439.1 Result ---
The weather data for Cibubur, Indonesia around August 16, 2024 at 22:30 local time (15:30 UTC) shows a typical temperature of about 12.1°C and zero direct solar radiation. Compared to the anomalous readings of 2.96°C temperature and 1000 W/m² solar radiation, the actual temperature is significantly higher and the solar radiation is expectedly zero at night. This confirms that the anomalous temperature reading is unusually low by approximately 9.1°C and the solar radiation reading is physically impossible at that time, indicating sensor errors or faults. The typical conditions do not support the anomaly values, reinforcing the likelihood of sensor malfunction or calibration issues.

Technical Specification Summary for Vaisala HMP155 Temperature Sensor:

1. Operational Temperature Range: -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F).
2. Accuracy:
   - For -80 to +20 °C: ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × temperature) °C
   - For +20 to +60 °C: ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × temperature) °C
3. Sensitivity: The sensor includes a Pt100 element typically sensitive to about 0.1 °C changes.

Assessment of Reported Temperature (2.96 °C):
- The reported temperature of 2.96 °C is well within the operational temperature range of the sensor (-80 to +60 °C).
- Given the accuracy formula, the expected accuracy at 2.96 °C is approximately ±0.217 °C, indicating the reading is plausible within sensor limits.

Sensor Sensitivity and Night-time Temperature Trends:
- The sensor sensitivity aligns with expected capability to detect small temperature changes, suitable for night-time temperature monitoring.
- However, the reported temperature (2.96 °C) is significantly lower than the expected night-time average (~28 °C) at the location, suggesting a possible sensor calibration error or malfunction rather than a sensitivity issue.

Conclusion on Sensor Suitability:
- The Vaisala HMP155 sensor is suitable for the temperature range and sensitivity required for the location.
- The anomalous low temperature reading is not due to sensor range or sensitivity limitations but likely due to sensor fault or calibration error.

This summary supports the conclusion that the sensor is operationally appropriate but the specific reading of 2.96 °C is anomalous and warrants maintenance or recalibration.

--- Subtask b2308c7a-2173-4a4e-9325-85606ee3d439.3 Result ---
The Kipp & Zonen CMP3 solar radiation sensor has an operational irradiance range of 0 to 1500 W/m² and a maximum operational irradiance of 2000 W/m². Its sensitivity ranges from 5 to 20 µV/W/m². The sensor operates within a temperature range of -40 °C to +80 °C and relative humidity from 0 to 100%. It has a response time of less than 6 seconds for 63% response and less than 12 seconds for 95% response. Regarding the reported solar radiation of 1000 W/m² at night, this value is within the sensor's operational range but physically unrealistic for night-time conditions, indicating a sensor fault or misreading rather than a valid measurement. The sensor sensitivity aligns with expected solar radiation trends, which should be near zero at night; thus, a high reading like 1000 W/m² at night does not correspond to normal night-time solar radiation trends. In conclusion, while the sensor's specifications support measuring up to 1500 W/m², the anomalous night-time reading of 1000 W/m² is not consistent with expected environmental conditions and suggests sensor malfunction or error. The sensor is suitable for solar radiation measurement within its range but requires maintenance or troubleshooting to address such anomalies.

    1. CMP 3 Kipp and Zonen Pyranometer
Maintenance/Recalibrations
Inspect and clean the outer dome every week or so. Clean any accumulated
dust or debris off the dome and pyranometer body using a soft cloth dampened
with water or alcohol. Check that there is no condensation within the dome.
Check the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a
fault. When doing this you should be aware of several expected phenomena
that can cause strange measurements. In particular on clear, windless nights the
outer dome temperature of horizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as
the dew point temperature of the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with
the cold sky. (The effective sky temperature can be 30 °C lower than the
ground temperature, which results in an infrared emission of –150 W/m2). If
this happens, dew, glazed frost or hoar frost can be precipitated on the top of
the outer dome and can stay there for several hours in the morning. An ice cap
on the dome is a strong diffuser and can increase the pyranometer signal by up
to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.
The calibration of the CMP3 may drift with time and exposure to radiation.
Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The sensor
should be returned to Campbell Scientific, the manufacturer, or a calibration
lab with facilities to calibrate radiation sensors

Troubleshooting
Symptom: –9999 or radiation values around 0
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the terminal that is specified by the
measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the range is correct for the data logger type.
3. Measure the impedance across the red and blue sensor wires. This should
be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1 ohm/m). If the
resistance is very low there may be a short circuit (check the wiring).
Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water ingress
into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite, there is
a broken connection (check the wiring).
4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.
With the sensor located 20 cm (8 inches) below a 60 W incandescent light
bulb, the voltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a
problem with the sensor.
Symptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low
1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the
data logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual
calibration factor.
2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.
Symptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations
1. 2. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation
(radar, radio).
Check the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.
3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.



CMP6, CMP10, CMP11, CMP21 Kipp and Zonen Maintenance

Maintenance
Every week, physically inspect the pyranometer to ensure that:
• Dome is free of dirt, condensation, and ice. Remove accumulated dust,
condensation, or ice from the dome and pyranometer body by using a soft
cloth dampened with water or alcohol (FIGURE 8-1).
• The drying cartridge in the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 have orange and
opaque desiccant granules (Section 8.1.1, Changing the Desiccant (p. 16)).
• Mounting is secure.
• Pyranometer is level or is at the correct angle.
• Cables are in good condition.

Changing the Desiccant
The CMP10 has an internal drying cartridge that will last for at least ten years
if the housing is not opened. This significantly minimizes maintenance.
The drying cartridge of the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 uses desiccant that
needs to be periodically replaced. The silica gel desiccant granules in the
drying cartridge should be orange and opaque. Replace the desiccant granules
when they become translucent (normally after several months). Refill packs of
desiccant are shipped with the pyranometer and can be purchased from
Campbell Scientific. The drying cartridge uses the content of one refill pack.
FIGURE 8-2 shows the replacement process.
When changing the desiccant, ensure that:
• Surfaces touching the rubber O-ring are clean. Dirt, in combination with
water, can cause corrosion, harming it.
• Rubber O-ring is coated with silicon grease or petroleum jelly. The grease
coating improves the O-ring seal.
• Drying cartridge is tightly threaded into the pyranometer body.

Check Sensor Output
Check the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a
fault. However, several expected phenomena can cause strange measurements.
In particular, on clear, windless nights the outer dome temperature of
horizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as the dew point temperature
of the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with the cold sky. (The effective
sky temperature can be 30 °C lower than the ground temperature, which results
in an infrared emission of –150 W•m–2). If this happens, dew, glazed frost or
hoar frost can form on the top of the outer dome and can stay there for several
hours in the morning. An ice cap on the dome is a strong diffuser and can
increase the pyranometer signal by up to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.

Recalibration
The calibration of the pyranometer may drift with time and exposure to
radiation. Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The
sensor should be returned to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. Refer to the
Assistance page for information on returning the pyranometer to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: NAN, –9999, or radiation values around 0
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the differential terminal specified by the
measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the range code is correct for the data logger type.
3. Measure the impedance across the white and black sensor wires. This
should be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1
ohm•m–1). If the resistance is low, there may be a short circuit (check the
wiring). Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water
ingress into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite,
there is a broken connection (check the wiring).
4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.
With the sensor located 8 inches below a 60 W incandescent light bulb the
voltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a problem
with the sensor.
Symptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low
1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the
data logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual
calibration factor.
2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.
Symptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations
1. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation,
such as radar or radio interference.
2. Check the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.
3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
Vaisala HUMICAPâ Humidity and Temperature Probe
HMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature
measurement. It is designed especially for demanding
outdoor applications.

HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
Vaisala HUMICAPâ Humidity and Temperature Probe
HMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature
measurement. It is designed especially for demanding
outdoor applications.

    1. CMP 3 Kipp and Zonen Pyranometer
Maintenance/Recalibrations
Inspect and clean the outer dome every week or so. Clean any accumulated
dust or debris off the dome and pyranometer body using a soft cloth dampened
with water or alcohol. Check that there is no condensation within the dome.
Check the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a
fault. When doing this you should be aware of several expected phenomena
that can cause strange measurements. In particular on clear, windless nights the
outer dome temperature of horizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as
the dew point temperature of the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with
the cold sky. (The effective sky temperature can be 30 °C lower than the
ground temperature, which results in an infrared emission of –150 W/m2). If
this happens, dew, glazed frost or hoar frost can be precipitated on the top of
the outer dome and can stay there for several hours in the morning. An ice cap
on the dome is a strong diffuser and can increase the pyranometer signal by up
to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.
The calibration of the CMP3 may drift with time and exposure to radiation.
Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The sensor
should be returned to Campbell Scientific, the manufacturer, or a calibration
lab with facilities to calibrate radiation sensors

Troubleshooting
Symptom: –9999 or radiation values around 0
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the terminal that is specified by the
measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the range is correct for the data logger type.
3. Measure the impedance across the red and blue sensor wires. This should
be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1 ohm/m). If the
resistance is very low there may be a short circuit (check the wiring).
Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water ingress
into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite, there is
a broken connection (check the wiring).
4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.
With the sensor located 20 cm (8 inches) below a 60 W incandescent light
bulb, the voltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a
problem with the sensor.
Symptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low
1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the
data logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual
calibration factor.
2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.
Symptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations

CMP6, CMP10, CMP11, CMP21 Kipp and Zonen Maintenance

Maintenance
Every week, physically inspect the pyranometer to ensure that:
• Dome is free of dirt, condensation, and ice. Remove accumulated dust,
condensation, or ice from the dome and pyranometer body by using a soft
cloth dampened with water or alcohol (FIGURE 8-1).
• The drying cartridge in the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 have orange and
opaque desiccant granules (Section 8.1.1, Changing the Desiccant (p. 16)).
• Mounting is secure.
• Pyranometer is level or is at the correct angle.
• Cables are in good condition.

Changing the Desiccant
The CMP10 has an internal drying cartridge that will last for at least ten years
if the housing is not opened. This significantly minimizes maintenance.
The drying cartridge of the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 uses desiccant that
needs to be periodically replaced. The silica gel desiccant granules in the
drying cartridge should be orange and opaque. Replace the desiccant granules
when they become translucent (normally after several months). Refill packs of
desiccant are shipped with the pyranometer and can be purchased from
Campbell Scientific. The drying cartridge uses the content of one refill pack.
FIGURE 8-2 shows the replacement process.
When changing the desiccant, ensure that:
• Surfaces touching the rubber O-ring are clean. Dirt, in combination with
water, can cause corrosion, harming it.
• Rubber O-ring is coated with silicon grease or petroleum jelly. The grease
coating improves the O-ring seal.
• Drying cartridge is tightly threaded into the pyranometer body.

Check Sensor Output
Check the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a
fault. However, several expected phenomena can cause strange measurements.
In particular, on clear, windless nights the outer dome temperature of
horizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as the dew point temperature
of the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with the cold sky. (The effective
sky temperature can be 30 °C lower than the ground temperature, which results
in an infrared emission of –150 W•m–2). If this happens, dew, glazed frost or
hoar frost can form on the top of the outer dome and can stay there for several
hours in the morning. An ice cap on the dome is a strong diffuser and can
increase the pyranometer signal by up to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.

Recalibration
The calibration of the pyranometer may drift with time and exposure to
radiation. Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The
sensor should be returned to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. Refer to the
Assistance page for information on returning the pyranometer to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: NAN, –9999, or radiation values around 0
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the differential terminal specified by the
measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the range code is correct for the data logger type.
3. Measure the impedance across the white and black sensor wires. This
should be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1
ohm•m–1). If the resistance is low, there may be a short circuit (check the
wiring). Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water
ingress into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite,
there is a broken connection (check the wiring).
4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.
With the sensor located 8 inches below a 60 W incandescent light bulb the

ISO 9060 & IEC 61724 Class B
Fully compliant with ISO 9060:2018 spectrally flat Class 
B specifications, the CMP6 and SMP6 deliver excellent 
spectral absorption and long-term stability characteristics. 
Compared to the CMP3 & SMP3 models, these instruments 
provide improved performance due to the increased thermal 
mass and the double glass dome construction. 
Minimized maintenance
The CMP6 and SMP6 are robust pyranometers that have 
been designed to provide high quality measurements with 
little maintenance needs. The CMP6 has an easy-to-remove 
drying cartridge filled with easy-to-replace desiccant that is 
supplied in convenient refill packets. In contrast, the SMP6 
is fitted with a maintenance-free internal desiccant that 
lasts at least 10 years. 
Analog or digital outputs
The CMP6 does not require any power. Incoming solar 
radiation generates a continuous millivolt output, which 
is converted in a data logger to irradiance in W/m² using 
the calibrated sensitivity. For easy integration into SCADA 
systems the SMP6 has Modbus ® RTU RS-485 serial 
communication, plus an amplified analog output. The 
sensitivity is stored inside for standardized outputs and it 
features improved response time and digital temperature 
compensation.
5 years warranty

CMP6, CMP10, CMP11, CMP21 Kipp and Zonen Maintenance

Maintenance
Every week, physically inspect the pyranometer to ensure that:
• Dome is free of dirt, condensation, and ice. Remove accumulated dust,
condensation, or ice from the dome and pyranometer body by using a soft
cloth dampened with water or alcohol (FIGURE 8-1).
• The drying cartridge in the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 have orange and
opaque desiccant granules (Section 8.1.1, Changing the Desiccant (p. 16)).
• Mounting is secure.
• Pyranometer is level or is at the correct angle.
• Cables are in good condition.

Changing the Desiccant
The CMP10 has an internal drying cartridge that will last for at least ten years
if the housing is not opened. This significantly minimizes maintenance.
The drying cartridge of the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 uses desiccant that
needs to be periodically replaced. The silica gel desiccant granules in the
drying cartridge should be orange and opaque. Replace the desiccant granules
when they become translucent (normally after several months). Refill packs of
desiccant are shipped with the pyranometer and can be purchased from
Campbell Scientific. The drying cartridge uses the content of one refill pack.
FIGURE 8-2 shows the replacement process.
When changing the desiccant, ensure that:
• Surfaces touching the rubber O-ring are clean. Dirt, in combination with
water, can cause corrosion, harming it.
• Rubber O-ring is coated with silicon grease or petroleum jelly. The grease
coating improves the O-ring seal.
• Drying cartridge is tightly threaded into the pyranometer body.

    1. CMP 3 Kipp and Zonen Pyranometer
Maintenance/Recalibrations
Inspect and clean the outer dome every week or so. Clean any accumulated
dust or debris off the dome and pyranometer body using a soft cloth dampened
with water or alcohol. Check that there is no condensation within the dome.
Check the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a
fault. When doing this you should be aware of several expected phenomena
that can cause strange measurements. In particular on clear, windless nights the
outer dome temperature of horizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as
the dew point temperature of the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with
the cold sky. (The effective sky temperature can be 30 °C lower than the
ground temperature, which results in an infrared emission of –150 W/m2). If
this happens, dew, glazed frost or hoar frost can be precipitated on the top of
the outer dome and can stay there for several hours in the morning. An ice cap
on the dome is a strong diffuser and can increase the pyranometer signal by up
to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.
The calibration of the CMP3 may drift with time and exposure to radiation.
Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The sensor
should be returned to Campbell Scientific, the manufacturer, or a calibration
lab with facilities to calibrate radiation sensors

Troubleshooting
Symptom: –9999 or radiation values around 0
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the terminal that is specified by the
measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the range is correct for the data logger type.
3. Measure the impedance across the red and blue sensor wires. This should
be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1 ohm/m). If the
resistance is very low there may be a short circuit (check the wiring).
Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water ingress
into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite, there is
a broken connection (check the wiring).
4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.
With the sensor located 20 cm (8 inches) below a 60 W incandescent light
bulb, the voltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a
problem with the sensor.
Symptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low
1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the
data logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual
calibration factor.
2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.
Symptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations
1. 2. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation
(radar, radio).
Check the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.
3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.



CMP6, CMP10, CMP11, CMP21 Kipp and Zonen Maintenance

Maintenance
Every week, physically inspect the pyranometer to ensure that:
• Dome is free of dirt, condensation, and ice. Remove accumulated dust,
condensation, or ice from the dome and pyranometer body by using a soft
cloth dampened with water or alcohol (FIGURE 8-1).
• The drying cartridge in the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 have orange and
opaque desiccant granules (Section 8.1.1, Changing the Desiccant (p. 16)).
• Mounting is secure.
• Pyranometer is level or is at the correct angle.
• Cables are in good condition.

Changing the Desiccant
The CMP10 has an internal drying cartridge that will last for at least ten years
if the housing is not opened. This significantly minimizes maintenance.
The drying cartridge of the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 uses desiccant that
needs to be periodically replaced. The silica gel desiccant granules in the
drying cartridge should be orange and opaque. Replace the desiccant granules
when they become translucent (normally after several months). Refill packs of
desiccant are shipped with the pyranometer and can be purchased from
Campbell Scientific. The drying cartridge uses the content of one refill pack.
FIGURE 8-2 shows the replacement process.
When changing the desiccant, ensure that:
• Surfaces touching the rubber O-ring are clean. Dirt, in combination with
water, can cause corrosion, harming it.
• Rubber O-ring is coated with silicon grease or petroleum jelly. The grease
coating improves the O-ring seal.
• Drying cartridge is tightly threaded into the pyranometer body.

Check Sensor Output
Check the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a
fault. However, several expected phenomena can cause strange measurements.
In particular, on clear, windless nights the outer dome temperature of
horizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as the dew point temperature
of the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with the cold sky. (The effective
sky temperature can be 30 °C lower than the ground temperature, which results
in an infrared emission of –150 W•m–2). If this happens, dew, glazed frost or
hoar frost can form on the top of the outer dome and can stay there for several
hours in the morning. An ice cap on the dome is a strong diffuser and can
increase the pyranometer signal by up to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.

Recalibration
The calibration of the pyranometer may drift with time and exposure to
radiation. Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The
sensor should be returned to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. Refer to the
Assistance page for information on returning the pyranometer to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: NAN, –9999, or radiation values around 0
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the differential terminal specified by the
measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the range code is correct for the data logger type.
3. Measure the impedance across the white and black sensor wires. This
should be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1
ohm•m–1). If the resistance is low, there may be a short circuit (check the
wiring). Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water
ingress into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite,
there is a broken connection (check the wiring).
4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.
With the sensor located 8 inches below a 60 W incandescent light bulb the
voltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a problem
with the sensor.
Symptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low
1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the
data logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual
calibration factor.
2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.
Symptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations
1. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation,
such as radar or radio interference.
2. Check the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.
3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.

Applications
CMP6 | SMP6 
ISO 9060 & IEC 61724 Class B
Fully compliant with ISO 9060:2018 spectrally flat Class 
B specifications, the CMP6 and SMP6 deliver excellent 
spectral absorption and long-term stability characteristics. 
Compared to the CMP3 & SMP3 models, these instruments 
provide improved performance due to the increased thermal 
mass and the double glass dome construction. 
Minimized maintenance
The CMP6 and SMP6 are robust pyranometers that have 
been designed to provide high quality measurements with 
little maintenance needs. The CMP6 has an easy-to-remove 
drying cartridge filled with easy-to-replace desiccant that is 
supplied in convenient refill packets. In contrast, the SMP6 
is fitted with a maintenance-free internal desiccant that 
lasts at least 10 years. 
Analog or digital outputs
The CMP6 does not require any power. Incoming solar 
radiation generates a continuous millivolt output, which 
is converted in a data logger to irradiance in W/m² using 
the calibrated sensitivity. For easy integration into SCADA 
systems the SMP6 has Modbus ® RTU RS-485 serial 
communication, plus an amplified analog output. The 
sensitivity is stored inside for standardized outputs and it 
features improved response time and digital temperature 
compensation.
5 years warranty
All pyranometers from Kipp & Zonen come with a 5-year 
warranty and we have service and calibration centers 
around the world.

Query #6:
  Query: Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor operational temperature range sensitivity specifications
  Dataset: sensor_knowledge
  Node Sets: temperature_humidity_sensor
  Results: 2
  
  Document Chunks:
    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed
every yea

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
Vaisala HUMICAPâ Humidity and Temperature Probe
HMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature
measurement. It is designed especially for demanding

    1. CMP 3 Kipp and Zonen Pyranometer
Maintenance/Recalibrations
Inspect and clean the outer dome every week or so. Clean any accumulated
dust or debris off the dome and pyranometer body using a soft cloth dampened
with water or alcohol. Check that there is no condensation within the dome.
Check the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a
fault. When doing this you should be aware of several expected phenomena
that can cause strange measurements. In particular on clear, windless nights the
outer dome temperature of horizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as
the dew point temperature of the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with
the cold sky. (The effective sky temperature can be 30 °C lower than the
ground temperature, which results in an infrared emission of –150 W/m2). If
this happens, dew, glazed frost or hoar frost can be precipitated on the top of
the outer dome and can stay there for several hours in the morning. An ice cap
on the dome is a strong diffuser and can increase the pyranometer signal by up
to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.
The calibration of the CMP3 may drift with time and exposure to radiation.
Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The sensor
should be returned to Campbell Scientific, the manufacturer, or a calibration
lab with facilities to calibrate radiation sensors

Troubleshooting
Symptom: –9999 or radiation values around 0
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the terminal that is specified by the
measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the range is correct for the data logger type.
3. Measure the impedance across the red and blue sensor wires. This should
be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1 ohm/m). If the
resistance is very low there may be a short circuit (check the wiring).
Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water ingress
into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite, there is
a broken connection (check the wiring).
4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.
With the sensor located 20 cm (8 inches) below a 60 W incandescent light
bulb, the voltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a
problem with the sensor.
Symptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low
1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the
data logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual
calibration factor.
2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.
Symptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations
1. 2. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation
(radar, radio).
Check the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.
3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.



CMP6, CMP10, CMP11, CMP21 Kipp and Zonen Maintenance

Maintenance
Every week, physically inspect the pyranometer to ensure that:
• Dome is free of dirt, condensation, and ice. Remove accumulated dust,
condensation, or ice from the dome and pyranometer body by using a soft
cloth dampened with water or alcohol (FIGURE 8-1).
• The drying cartridge in the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 have orange and
opaque desiccant granules (Section 8.1.1, Changing the Desiccant (p. 16)).
• Mounting is secure.
• Pyranometer is level or is at the correct angle.
• Cables are in good condition.

Changing the Desiccant
The CMP10 has an internal drying cartridge that will last for at least ten years
if the housing is not opened. This significantly minimizes maintenance.
The drying cartridge of the CMP6, CMP11, and CMP21 uses desiccant that
needs to be periodically replaced. The silica gel desiccant granules in the
drying cartridge should be orange and opaque. Replace the desiccant granules
when they become translucent (normally after several months). Refill packs of
desiccant are shipped with the pyranometer and can be purchased from
Campbell Scientific. The drying cartridge uses the content of one refill pack.
FIGURE 8-2 shows the replacement process.
When changing the desiccant, ensure that:
• Surfaces touching the rubber O-ring are clean. Dirt, in combination with
water, can cause corrosion, harming it.
• Rubber O-ring is coated with silicon grease or petroleum jelly. The grease
coating improves the O-ring seal.
• Drying cartridge is tightly threaded into the pyranometer body.

Check Sensor Output
Check the data returned from the sensor as it will show the first indication of a
fault. However, several expected phenomena can cause strange measurements.
In particular, on clear, windless nights the outer dome temperature of
horizontally placed pyranometers can fall as low as the dew point temperature
of the air, due to infrared radiation exchange with the cold sky. (The effective
sky temperature can be 30 °C lower than the ground temperature, which results
in an infrared emission of –150 W•m–2). If this happens, dew, glazed frost or
hoar frost can form on the top of the outer dome and can stay there for several
hours in the morning. An ice cap on the dome is a strong diffuser and can
increase the pyranometer signal by up to 50% in the first hours after sunrise.

Recalibration
The calibration of the pyranometer may drift with time and exposure to
radiation. Campbell Scientific recommends recalibrating every two years. The
sensor should be returned to Campbell Scientific for recalibration. Refer to the
Assistance page for information on returning the pyranometer to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: NAN, –9999, or radiation values around 0
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the differential terminal specified by the
measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the range code is correct for the data logger type.
3. Measure the impedance across the white and black sensor wires. This
should be around 100 ohms plus the cable resistance (typically 0.1
ohm•m–1). If the resistance is low, there may be a short circuit (check the
wiring). Resistances somewhat lower than expected could be due to water
ingress into the sensor or enclosure connectors. If the resistance is infinite,
there is a broken connection (check the wiring).
4. Disconnect the sensor cable and check the voltage output from the sensor.
With the sensor located 8 inches below a 60 W incandescent light bulb the
voltage should be approximately 2.5 mV. No voltage indicates a problem
with the sensor.
Symptom: sensor signal is unrealistically high or low
1. Check that the right calibration factor has been properly entered into the
data logger program. Please note that each sensor has its own individual
calibration factor.
2. Check the condition of the sensor cable.
Symptom: sensor signal shows unexpected variations
1. Check for the presence of strong sources of electromagnetic radiation,
such as radar or radio interference.
2. Check the condition and the connection of the sensor shield wire.
3. Check the condition of the sensor cable.

Applications
CMP6 | SMP6 
ISO 9060 & IEC 61724 Class B
Fully compliant with ISO 9060:2018 spectrally flat Class 
B specifications, the CMP6 and SMP6 deliver excellent 
spectral absorption and long-term stability characteristics. 
Compared to the CMP3 & SMP3 models, these instruments 
provide improved performance due to the increased thermal 
mass and the double glass dome construction. 
Minimized maintenance
The CMP6 and SMP6 are robust pyranometers that have 
been designed to provide high quality measurements with 
little maintenance needs. The CMP6 has an easy-to-remove 
drying cartridge filled with easy-to-replace desiccant that is 
supplied in convenient refill packets. In contrast, the SMP6 
is fitted with a maintenance-free internal desiccant that 
lasts at least 10 years. 
Analog or digital outputs
The CMP6 does not require any power. Incoming solar 
radiation generates a continuous millivolt output, which 
is converted in a data logger to irradiance in W/m² using 
the calibrated sensitivity. For easy integration into SCADA 
systems the SMP6 has Modbus ® RTU RS-485 serial 
communication, plus an amplified analog output. The 
sensitivity is stored inside for standardized outputs and it 
features improved response time and digital temperature 
compensation.
5 years warranty
All pyranometers from Kipp & Zonen come with a 5-year 
warranty and we have service and calibration centers 
around the world.

Query #8:
  Query: troubleshooting guides, common failure modes, and recommended maintenance actions for Vaisala HMP155 temperature sensor stuck low temperature reading or calibration error
  Dataset: maintenance_knowledge
  Node Sets: temperature_humidity_sensor
  Results: 2
  
  Document Chunks:
    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed
every yea

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
Vaisala HUMICAPâ Humidity and Temperature Probe
HMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature
measurement. It is designed especially for demanding
outdoor applications.
