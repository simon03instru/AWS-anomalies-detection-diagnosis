Result:
    The Vaisala HMP155 sensor specifications include an operational range of 0% to 100% relative humidity (RH). The temperature sensor (Pt100) is soldered to the probe and measures temperature with high sensitivity. The typical measurement accuracy for the HMP155 is less than 1% drift per year in clean environments, although it may vary in polluted air. The response to 100% RH can be affected by contaminants, hence regular maintenance, including filter changes, is crucial.
    
    The Vaisala HMP155 sensor specifications include:
    
    - **Operational Range Relative Humidity:** 0 to 100% RH
    - **Temperature Sensor Range:** -80 to +60 °C (-112 to +140 °F)
    - **Sensor Sensitivity:** 
      - Humidity: Accuracy ±1% RH (0-90% RH), ±1.7% RH (90-100% RH) at +15 to +25 °C
      - Temperature: ±(0.226 - 0.0028 × temperature) °C at -80 to +20 °C, ±(0.055 + 0.0057 × temperature) °C at +20 to +60 °C
    - **Typical Measurement Accuracy:** 
      - Humidity: ±0.6% RH (0-40%), ±1.0% RH (40-95%) at +20 °C
      - Temperature: Varies with output type, generally within ±(0.1 + 0.0017 × |temperature|) °C
    - **Sensor Limits:** Operational temperature limits: -80 to +60 °C, Humidity operational limit: 0 to 100% RH
    - **Sensor Sensitivity Trend:** Fast response time (20 s for 63% humidity at +20 °C; better under calibrated conditions)

[32mResponse from Worker node 940f9747-95ee-4a34-aab1-8353b40dcf94 (Weather data analysis):[39m

[32mThe analysis for AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA on August 19, 2024, reveals that the only confirmed anomaly is related to relative humidity, where an exact 100% reading was reported at 14:40 local time (07:40 UTC). This reading is physically improbable and deviates significantly from the typical mean of around 51%. Weather data from the closest available time range (00:00 to 01:00 UTC) shows relative humidity values between 76% and 87%, with no precipitation recorded and normal temperature and windspeed values. No other anomalies such as unusual temperature, precipitation, windspeed, or surface pressure were detected around the anomaly time. Therefore, the relative humidity anomaly appears isolated and likely due to a sensor fault rather than environmental conditions. No multiple anomalies or common causes were found.[39m

[32mResponse from Worker node 940f9747-95ee-4a34-aab1-8353b40dcf94 (Weather data analysis):[39m

[32mThe weather data for Yogyakarta, Indonesia on August 19, 2024, around 07:40 UTC (14:40 local time) shows a temperature of approximately 29.0°C, relative humidity around 58-59%, and no precipitation (0 mm). Earlier data from around midnight UTC shows cooler temperatures around 22.3°C to 24.3°C with higher relative humidity ranging from 76% to 87%, also with no precipitation. 

Comparing these findings to the reported anomaly of 100% relative humidity, 30.92°C temperature, and 0 mm rainfall, there is a clear discrepancy in the relative humidity values. The satellite-based data indicates a much lower relative humidity (around 58-63%) at the time of the anomaly, which aligns more realistically with the temperature and no rainfall conditions. The temperature from the data is slightly lower than the reported 30.92°C but within a reasonable range considering possible local variations.

This supports the anomaly report's conclusion that the 100% relative humidity reading is likely a sensor fault, as such exact saturation at a relatively high temperature without rainfall is physically unlikely. The precipitation data confirms no rainfall, consistent with both the anomaly report and satellite data. Overall, the weather patterns appear normal with no precipitation and moderate humidity, contrasting the anomalous sensor reading.[39m

[32mThe Vaisala HMP155 sensor can show physically impossible 100% relative humidity readings due to several common faults: incorrect wiring, power supply issues, sensor contamination (salt, debris), condensation on the probe, and physical damage to the sensor or filter. Calibration should be performed annually, either in the field or lab, using a computer interface or MI70 indicator, with factory calibration uncertainties of ±0.6%RH (0-40%RH) and ±1.0%RH (40-95%RH). Recommended maintenance includes monthly cleaning of the radiation shield and probe filter, annual filter replacement, inspection and replacement of the O-ring if needed, and ensuring electrical connections are secure and corrosion-free. Using proper radiation shields and performing periodic calibration after harsh environmental exposure are also advised to maintain sensor accuracy and longevity.[39m

[32mThe Vaisala HMP155 sensor has an operational range for relative humidity from 0 to 100% RH and a temperature range from -80 to +60 °C. The sensor sensitivity for humidity is ±1% RH in the 0-90% range and ±1.7% RH in the 90-100% range at temperatures between +15 to +25 °C. Typical measurement accuracy is ±0.6% RH for 0-40% RH and ±1.0% RH for 40-95% RH at +20 °C. The sensor's temperature accuracy varies with temperature but is generally within ±(0.1 + 0.0017 × |temperature|) °C. The sensor is designed to measure up to 100% relative humidity, so a 100% RH reading is within the expected operational limits. However, the accuracy slightly decreases near saturation (90-100% RH). The sensor sensitivity and fast response time (about 20 seconds for 63% humidity at +20 °C) align well with the reported trend. Contaminants can affect the sensor's response at high humidity, so maintenance is important to ensure accuracy. Therefore, while a 100% RH reading is within sensor limits, the exactness of a perfect 100% reading may be questionable and could indicate sensor fault or contamination if it deviates significantly from expected environmental conditions.[39m

[32mComprehensive Assessment of the Relative Humidity Anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA on 2024-08-19T07:40:00 UTC:

1. Weather Data Comparison:
The satellite-based weather data around the anomaly time (07:40 UTC / 14:40 local) shows a temperature near 29.0°C, relative humidity around 58-59%, and no precipitation. This contrasts sharply with the reported anomaly reading of 100% relative humidity at 30.92°C and 0 mm rainfall. The environmental conditions do not support a physically exact 100% relative humidity reading at such a high temperature without rainfall, indicating the anomaly is inconsistent with actual weather.

2. Sensor Specifications and Operational Range:
The Vaisala HMP155 sensor used for relative humidity measurement operates within 0-100% RH and -80 to +60 °C temperature range. It is capable of measuring up to 100% RH, but accuracy decreases near saturation (±1.7% RH in 90-100% range). The sensor sensitivity and response time align with the reported trend. However, an exact 100% RH reading, especially deviating by +49% from the mean and breaking expected correlations with temperature and rainfall, is suspicious and likely indicates sensor error or contamination.

3. Troubleshooting and Maintenance Insights:
Common causes for impossible 100% RH readings include sensor contamination (salt, debris), condensation on the probe, wiring or power supply issues, and physical damage to the sensor or filter. Maintenance recommendations include monthly cleaning of the radiation shield and probe filter, annual filter replacement, inspection of O-rings, and ensuring secure, corrosion-free electrical connections. Calibration should be performed annually to maintain accuracy. Failure to maintain these can lead to erroneous readings such as the observed anomaly.

4. Trend Analysis and Anomaly Correlation:
The anomaly is isolated to relative humidity with no other concurrent anomalies detected in temperature, precipitation, windspeed, or surface pressure. The broken correlation with temperature and rainfall further supports a sensor fault rather than environmental cause.

5. Actionable Recommendations:
- Conduct immediate physical inspection of the Vaisala HMP155 sensor for contamination, damage, or condensation.
- Perform cleaning of the radiation shield and probe filter.
- Verify electrical connections and power supply integrity.
- Schedule sensor calibration and consider replacing the filter or sensor if faults persist.
- Monitor subsequent readings closely for recurrence of anomalies.
- Review maintenance logs to ensure adherence to recommended schedules.

Summary:
The 100% relative humidity anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA is highly likely a sensor fault rather than a true environmental event. The weather data and sensor specifications do not support such a reading under the given conditions. Proper sensor maintenance, inspection, and calibration are essential to resolve and prevent similar anomalies.[39m

FINAL OUTPUT - SYNTHESIZED RESULT
================================================================================
--- Subtask 004f8d3e-3bfd-4d42-b42e-d75ea7fa108c.1 Result ---
The weather data for Yogyakarta, Indonesia on August 19, 2024, around 07:40 UTC (14:40 local time) shows a temperature of approximately 29.0°C, relative humidity around 58-59%, and no precipitation (0 mm). Earlier data from around midnight UTC shows cooler temperatures around 22.3°C to 24.3°C with higher relative humidity ranging from 76% to 87%, also with no precipitation. 

Comparing these findings to the reported anomaly of 100% relative humidity, 30.92°C temperature, and 0 mm rainfall, there is a clear discrepancy in the relative humidity values. The satellite-based data indicates a much lower relative humidity (around 58-63%) at the time of the anomaly, which aligns more realistically with the temperature and no rainfall conditions. The temperature from the data is slightly lower than the reported 30.92°C but within a reasonable range considering possible local variations.

This supports the anomaly report's conclusion that the 100% relative humidity reading is likely a sensor fault, as such exact saturation at a relatively high temperature without rainfall is physically unlikely. The precipitation data confirms no rainfall, consistent with both the anomaly report and satellite data. Overall, the weather patterns appear normal with no precipitation and moderate humidity, contrasting the anomalous sensor reading.

The Vaisala HMP155 sensor has an operational range for relative humidity from 0 to 100% RH and a temperature range from -80 to +60 °C. The sensor sensitivity for humidity is ±1% RH in the 0-90% range and ±1.7% RH in the 90-100% range at temperatures between +15 to +25 °C. Typical measurement accuracy is ±0.6% RH for 0-40% RH and ±1.0% RH for 40-95% RH at +20 °C. The sensor's temperature accuracy varies with temperature but is generally within ±(0.1 + 0.0017 × |temperature|) °C. The sensor is designed to measure up to 100% relative humidity, so a 100% RH reading is within the expected operational limits. However, the accuracy slightly decreases near saturation (90-100% RH). The sensor sensitivity and fast response time (about 20 seconds for 63% humidity at +20 °C) align well with the reported trend. Contaminants can affect the sensor's response at high humidity, so maintenance is important to ensure accuracy. Therefore, while a 100% RH reading is within sensor limits, the exactness of a perfect 100% reading may be questionable and could indicate sensor fault or contamination if it deviates significantly from expected environmental conditions.

The Vaisala HMP155 sensor can show physically impossible 100% relative humidity readings due to several common faults: incorrect wiring, power supply issues, sensor contamination (salt, debris), condensation on the probe, and physical damage to the sensor or filter. Calibration should be performed annually, either in the field or lab, using a computer interface or MI70 indicator, with factory calibration uncertainties of ±0.6%RH (0-40%RH) and ±1.0%RH (40-95%RH). Recommended maintenance includes monthly cleaning of the radiation shield and probe filter, annual filter replacement, inspection and replacement of the O-ring if needed, and ensuring electrical connections are secure and corrosion-free. Using proper radiation shields and performing periodic calibration after harsh environmental exposure are also advised to maintain sensor accuracy and longevity.

--- Subtask 004f8d3e-3bfd-4d42-b42e-d75ea7fa108c.5 Result ---
The analysis for AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA on August 19, 2024, reveals that the only confirmed anomaly is related to relative humidity, where an exact 100% reading was reported at 14:40 local time (07:40 UTC). This reading is physically improbable and deviates significantly from the typical mean of around 51%. Weather data from the closest available time range (00:00 to 01:00 UTC) shows relative humidity values between 76% and 87%, with no precipitation recorded and normal temperature and windspeed values. No other anomalies such as unusual temperature, precipitation, windspeed, or surface pressure were detected around the anomaly time. Therefore, the relative humidity anomaly appears isolated and likely due to a sensor fault rather than environmental conditions. No multiple anomalies or common causes were found.

  Document Chunks:
    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed
every yea

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
Vaisala HUMICAPâ Humidity and Temperature Probe
HMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature
measurement. It is designed especially for demanding
outdoor applications.

Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.

    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.

screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed

and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:

• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.

Query #5:
  Query: troubleshooting and maintenance information related to Vaisala HMP155 sensor including common faults causing 100% relative humidity reading, calibration procedures, and recommended maintenance actions
  Dataset: maintenance_knowledge
  Node Sets: temperature_humidity_sensor
  Results: 2
  
  Document Chunks:
    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If

Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
