[32mResponse from Worker node 55c4f920-01c7-4246-9660-936bf77b6caa (Weather data analysis):[39m

[32mThe weather data for UGM Yogyakarta around August 15, 2024, 20:10 UTC shows the following conditions: temperature approximately 20.5°C, no precipitation (0.0 mm), relative humidity around 86-87%, and zero direct solar radiation (consistent with nighttime). Compared to the anomalous sensor reading of 30% relative humidity at the same time, the satellite-based data indicates a much higher and typical humidity level near 86-87%, which aligns closely with the expected typical humidity of 76% ±2%. This large discrepancy suggests that the sensor reading of 30% relative humidity is likely erroneous or a sensor malfunction. The temperature and solar radiation values are consistent with nighttime conditions and show no anomalies. There is no precipitation recorded, which matches the expectation of no rainfall. Overall, the satellite data supports the conclusion that the reported sudden drop to 30% humidity is an anomaly likely due to sensor fault rather than actual atmospheric conditions.[39m

[32mResponse from Worker node 55c4f920-01c7-4246-9660-936bf77b6caa (Weather data analysis):[39m

[32mThe analysis of the weather anomaly at AWS_DIY_UGM on 2024-08-15T20:10:00 UTC reveals a sudden drop in relative humidity to 30%, which is significantly lower than the typical 76% ±2% for this location and time. Satellite-based weather data around this time shows relative humidity consistently around 86-87%, temperature near 20.5°C, zero precipitation, and zero direct solar radiation, all consistent with normal nighttime conditions. The temperature and solar radiation values align with expectations, and there is no rainfall recorded, which supports the conclusion that the environment was stable and typical.

The Vaisala HMP155 sensor used for measuring relative humidity operates reliably within 0-100% RH with an accuracy of ±1% RH in typical conditions. The sudden drop to 30% RH is outside the expected environmental variation and likely indicates a sensor malfunction rather than an actual atmospheric event.

Common causes for such sensor anomalies include wiring issues, power supply problems, contamination or obstruction of the probe filter, malfunction of the sensor's warming feature, improper installation or shielding, and the need for recalibration. Maintenance recommendations include verifying wiring and power supply, checking output voltages, inspecting and cleaning or replacing the probe filter, ensuring proper installation and shielding, confirming the warming feature is operational, allowing sufficient power-up time, and performing annual recalibration.

Given the broken expected correlation pattern between relative humidity, temperature, and solar radiation, and the stable environmental conditions, the most plausible cause is sensor fault. Immediate actions should focus on sensor diagnostics and maintenance using the checklist provided. If the sensor is confirmed faulty, replacement or recalibration is advised to restore accurate measurements.

In summary, the anomaly is best explained by sensor malfunction rather than environmental factors. Prompt maintenance and verification will prevent future erroneous data and ensure reliable monitoring at AWS_DIY_UGM.[39m

The weather data for UGM Yogyakarta around August 15, 2024, 20:10 UTC shows the following conditions: temperature approximately 20.5°C, no precipitation (0.0 mm), relative humidity around 86-87%, and zero direct solar radiation (consistent with nighttime). Compared to the anomalous sensor reading of 30% relative humidity at the same time, the satellite-based data indicates a much higher and typical humidity level near 86-87%, which aligns closely with the expected typical humidity of 76% ±2%. This large discrepancy suggests that the sensor reading of 30% relative humidity is likely erroneous or a sensor malfunction. The temperature and solar radiation values are consistent with nighttime conditions and show no anomalies. There is no precipitation recorded, which matches the expectation of no rainfall. Overall, the satellite data supports the conclusion that the reported sudden drop to 30% humidity is an anomaly likely due to sensor fault rather than actual atmospheric conditions.

The Vaisala HMP155 relative humidity sensor has an operational range of 0 to 100 %RH. It features a sensitivity with a response time of 20 seconds for 63% humidity and 60 seconds for 90% humidity at +20 °C in still air. The sensor accuracy is ±1 %RH within the 0 to 90 %RH range at temperatures between +15 to +25 °C, and ±1.7 %RH for the 90 to 100 %RH range. It is designed to operate reliably under typical environmental conditions, including harsh environments, with features such as a warmed probe to prevent condensation. Maintenance recommendations include regular cleaning of the radiation shield, annual or more frequent filter changes if exposed to pollution, and ensuring proper mounting and wiring to avoid measurement errors. These specifications indicate that the sensor should accurately measure relative humidity in normal conditions, and a sudden drop to 30% RH as reported in the anomaly is likely due to sensor malfunction or fault rather than environmental changes.

Troubleshooting sudden drops in relative humidity readings for the Vaisala HMP155 sensor involves the following steps:

1. Check Wiring: Ensure the sensor is wired correctly to the analog input channels as per measurement instructions.
2. Verify Power Supply: Confirm the red power wire is connected to the correct power terminal (12V or SW12V) and that a steady 12V supply is present.
3. Output Voltage Check: Use a voltmeter to measure output voltage on the yellow and blue wires for temperature and humidity signals.
4. Examine the Probe Filter: Inspect the sintered Teflon filter for contamination or obstruction by water, debris, or salt buildup (especially near ocean installations). Clean or replace if necessary.
5. Environmental Factors: Ensure the sensor is not exposed to heavy dew, fog, rain, or mist that could affect readings.
6. Sensor Warming Feature: Verify the additional warmed probe feature is functioning correctly to prevent condensation in high humidity environments.
7. Installation: Confirm the sensor is installed within a suitable radiation shield (DTR13 or DTR503) to protect from precipitation and solar radiation.
8. Power-Up Time: Ensure the sensor has adequate power-up time (at least 1.8 seconds) in the program.
9. Calibration: Recalibrate the sensor annually using a computer or MI70 indicator to maintain accuracy.

Maintenance Checklist for Vaisala HMP155 Relative Humidity Anomalies:
- Verify correct wiring and power supply.
- Measure output voltages for temperature and humidity signals.
- Inspect and clean/replace the probe filter.
- Check for salt contamination if near marine environments.
- Confirm proper sensor installation with radiation shielding.
- Ensure sensor warming feature is operational.
- Allow sufficient power-up time in software.
- Perform annual recalibration.

Following this checklist will help maintenance experts identify and resolve sensor malfunctions causing sudden drops in relative humidity readings.

The analysis of the weather anomaly at AWS_DIY_UGM on 2024-08-15T20:10:00 UTC reveals a sudden drop in relative humidity to 30%, which is significantly lower than the typical 76% ±2% for this location and time. Satellite-based weather data around this time shows relative humidity consistently around 86-87%, temperature near 20.5°C, zero precipitation, and zero direct solar radiation, all consistent with normal nighttime conditions. The temperature and solar radiation values align with expectations, and there is no rainfall recorded, which supports the conclusion that the environment was stable and typical.

The Vaisala HMP155 sensor used for measuring relative humidity operates reliably within 0-100% RH with an accuracy of ±1% RH in typical conditions. The sudden drop to 30% RH is outside the expected environmental variation and likely indicates a sensor malfunction rather than an actual atmospheric event.

Common causes for such sensor anomalies include wiring issues, power supply problems, contamination or obstruction of the probe filter, malfunction of the sensor's warming feature, improper installation or shielding, and the need for recalibration. Maintenance recommendations include verifying wiring and power supply, checking output voltages, inspecting and cleaning or replacing the probe filter, ensuring proper installation and shielding, confirming the warming feature is operational, allowing sufficient power-up time, and performing annual recalibration.

Given the broken expected correlation pattern between relative humidity, temperature, and solar radiation, and the stable environmental conditions, the most plausible cause is sensor fault. Immediate actions should focus on sensor diagnostics and maintenance using the checklist provided. If the sensor is confirmed faulty, replacement or recalibration is advised to restore accurate measurements.

In summary, the anomaly is best explained by sensor malfunction rather than environmental factors. Prompt maintenance and verification will prevent future erroneous data and ensure reliable monitoring at AWS_DIY_UGM.

    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.
