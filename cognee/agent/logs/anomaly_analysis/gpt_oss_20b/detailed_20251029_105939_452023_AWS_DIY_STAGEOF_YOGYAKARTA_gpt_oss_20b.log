[32m**Vaisala HMP155 Relative Humidity Sensor Specification Summary**
- **Operational Range:** 0 % RH to 100 % RH.
- **Accuracy:** ±1 % RH for 0–90 % RH; ±1.7 % RH for 90–100 % RH.
- **Response Time:** 20 s at 63 % RH, 60 s at 90 % RH (still air, +20 °C).

**Anomaly Compliance Assessment**
- The reported 100.0 % RH reading lies at the upper boundary of the sensor’s operational range. While the sensor is designed to measure up to 100 % RH, the accuracy at this level is ±1.7 % RH, meaning the true value could be 98.3–101.7 % RH.
- A *physically exact* 100 % RH reading is statistically unlikely and indicates a sensor fault or calibration issue, especially given the deviation from expected trends (temperature, rainfall, mean humidity).
- The sensor’s sensitivity (accuracy specification) does not support a perfectly stable 100 % reading; the trend analysis suggests the sensor is not matching the expected behavior.

**Conclusion**
- The 100 % reading is within the sensor’s specified range but is at the extreme where accuracy is reduced. The anomaly is not compliant with expected sensor behavior and likely reflects a fault.
- Recommend immediate sensor inspection, calibration verification, and potential replacement if the fault persists.

[32mThe anomaly at AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA on 2024‑08‑19 14:40 local (UTC+7) shows a 100 % relative humidity reading with a temperature of 30.92 °C. Weather data from the nearest satellite timestamp (07:45 UTC / 14:45 local) indicates a temperature of 29.2 °C, relative humidity of 57 %, and no rainfall. Thus the sensor reported a humidity that is 43 % higher and a temperature about 1.7 °C warmer than the actual conditions.

**Sensor compliance**: The Vaisala HMP155 operates from 0 % to 100 % RH with ±1.7 % accuracy at the upper end. A perfectly stable 100 % reading is statistically unlikely and falls at the edge of the sensor’s accuracy range, suggesting a fault rather than a true environmental condition.

**Possible causes**:
1. Probe contamination or moisture leading to a saturated reading.
2. Wiring or power issues causing erroneous output.
3. Calibration drift or failure of the warmed‑probe feature.
4. Environmental interference (e.g., precipitation, fog, solar radiation) not adequately shielded.

**Actionable recommendations**:
1. Inspect and clean the probe element; replace the filter if dirty.
2. Verify all wiring, power connections, and the warmed‑probe function.
3. Re‑calibrate the sensor according to Vaisala guidelines.
4. Ensure the radiation shield is properly installed and free of damage.
5. If the anomaly persists after these steps, replace the sensor.

Implementing these steps should resolve the 100 % RH anomaly and restore reliable humidity measurements.[39m

At 07:45 UTC (14:45 local), Yogyakarta had a temperature of 29.2 °C, relative humidity of 57 %, and no rainfall. The anomaly reported 100 % humidity and 30.92 °C. Thus the actual humidity was 43 % lower and the temperature about 1.7 °C cooler than the anomalous reading, indicating a likely sensor fault.

**Vaisala HMP155 Relative Humidity Sensor Specification Summary**
- **Operational Range:** 0 % RH to 100 % RH.
- **Accuracy:** ±1 % RH for 0–90 % RH; ±1.7 % RH for 90–100 % RH.
- **Response Time:** 20 s at 63 % RH, 60 s at 90 % RH (still air, +20 °C).

**Anomaly Compliance Assessment**
- The reported 100.0 % RH reading lies at the upper boundary of the sensor’s operational range. While the sensor is designed to measure up to 100 % RH, the accuracy at this level is ±1.7 % RH, meaning the true value could be 98.3–101.7 % RH.
- A *physically exact* 100 % RH reading is statistically unlikely and indicates a sensor fault or calibration issue, especially given the deviation from expected trends (temperature, rainfall, mean humidity).
- The sensor’s sensitivity (accuracy specification) does not support a perfectly stable 100 % reading; the trend analysis suggests the sensor is not matching the expected behavior.

**Conclusion**
- The 100 % reading is within the sensor’s specified range but is at the extreme where accuracy is reduced. The anomaly is not compliant with expected sensor behavior and likely reflects a fault.
- Recommend immediate sensor inspection, calibration verification, and potential replacement if the fault persists.

Troubleshooting steps and recommended maintenance for a Vaisala HMP155 sensor reporting 100% humidity:

1. **Check Wiring** – Verify the sensor is connected to the correct analog input channels as per the measurement instructions.
2. **Verify Power Connection** – Ensure the red power wire is connected to the 12 V or SW12 V channel required by the data logger.
3. **Inspect Probe Filter** – Examine the probe filter for contamination; replace if dirty, as this can affect humidity readings.
4. **Check Probe Condition** – Confirm the probe is not wet or contaminated; a wet probe can give inaccurate high‑humidity readings.
5. **Calibration** – Re‑calibrate the HMP155 annually (or as recommended) using a computer with a USB cable or the MI70 indicator to maintain accuracy.
6. **Warmed Probe Feature** – If the sensor has a warmed‑probe feature, ensure it is functioning to prevent condensation on the sensor.
7. **Clean the Sensor** – Gently clean the sensor element with distilled water if it appears dirty or contaminated.
8. **Avoid Environmental Factors** – Install the sensor in a suitable radiation shield to protect it from precipitation, fog, mist, and solar radiation; keep it away from sources of electrical interference.
9. **Check Connections** – Inspect all power and output connections for security and proper functioning.
10. **Test Output** – Use a voltmeter to measure the output voltage for temperature and humidity; compare against expected values.
11. **Error Codes** – If the device displays error codes, refer to the manual for specific troubleshooting steps.

Recommended maintenance actions:
- Replace the probe filter if contaminated.
- Re‑calibrate the sensor annually.
- Clean the sensor element with distilled water.
- Verify and secure all wiring and power connections.
- Ensure the warmed‑probe feature is operational.
- Install or update the radiation shield to protect against environmental interference.
- Document all maintenance actions and dates in the maintenance log.

These steps should resolve or identify the cause of the 100% humidity reading anomaly.

    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after

Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed

HUMICAPâ Humidity and
Temperature Probe HMP155
HMP155 with an additional
temperature probe and optional
Stevenson screen installation kit.
Features
• Vaisala HUMICAP â180R sensor:
superior long-term stability
• Optional warmed humidity probe
and chemical purge
• Plug-and-play
• USB connection for service use
• Use with DTR13 and DTR503
radiation shields and a Stevenson
screen
• Weather-proof housing IP66
• Optional, fast temperature probe
• Different output possibilities:
voltage, RS-485, resistive Pt100
• Applications: meteorology,
aviation and road weather,
instrumentation
Long-term stability
HMP155 uses the proven Vaisala
HUMICAPâ180R sensor that has excellent
stability and withstands well harsh
environments. The probe structure is
solid and the sensor is protected by
default with a sintered teflon filter, which
gives maximum protection against water,
dust, and dirt.
Warmed probe and high-
humidity environment
Measuring humidity reliably is
challenging in environments where
humidity is near saturation.
Measurements may be corrupted by fog,
mist, rain, and heavy dew. A wet probe
may not give an accurate measurement
in the ambient air.
This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.

HMP155 provides reliable humidity and temperature
measurement. It is designed especially for demanding
outdoor applications.

This is an environment to which Vaisala
has designed this patented, warmed
probe for reliable measurements. As
the sensor head is warmed continuously,
the humidity level inside it stays below
the ambient level. Thus, it also reduces
the risk of condensation forming on
the probe.
Fast measurements
With its fast response time,
the additional temperature probe for
HMP155 is ideal for measuring in
environments with changing
temperatures. The membrane filter
speeds up the relative humidity
measurement.
Long lifetime
Protecting the sensor from precipitation,
and scattered and direct solar radiation
increases its lifetime. Thus, Vaisala
recommends installing HMP155 in one of
the following radiation shields: DTR503,
DTR13, or Stevenson screen. For
the additional temperature probe,
an installation kit is available for Vaisala
DTR502 Radiation Shield.
Calibration
The probe can be calibrated using
a computer with a USB cable, with
the push buttons, or with the MI70
indicator.

  Document Chunks:
    1. HMP155 maintenance 

Preventive maintenance for HMP155 includes:
Checking that the probe is securely mounted.
Checking that the radiation shield and cable are intact.
Cleaning the radiation shield using mild detergent and a soft, lint-free cloth.
Changing the probe filter once a year.

If the measurement site is exposed to air pollution and dust, the probe filter may need to be changed more frequently.

Changing HMP155 probe filter
Over time, the probe filter becomes contaminated with matter that you cannot remove by cleaning. When this happens, the response time becomes longer and measurement accuracy decreases.
CAUTION The Pt100 temperature sensor is soldered to the probe. Do not try to remove it. Due to the operating principles of the sensor, no maintenance is required.
1. Remove the probe from inside the radiation shield.
2. Carefully remove the filter from the probe. Holding the filter by the plastic part, rotate the filter counterclockwise and pull it out.
CAUTION Do not touch the sensor heads.
3. After removing the filter, check the O‑ring and change it if necessary.
4. Install the new filter carefully without delay.
5. Install the probe back inside the radiation shield.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Relative Humidity is reported as –9999, NAN, –80 °C, or 0%
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the correct analog input channels as specified by the
measurement instructions.
2. 3. Verify the range code for the single-ended or differential measurement instruction is
correct for the data logger type.
Verify the red power wire is correctly wired to the 12V or SW12V channel. The channel the
wire is connected to will depend on the data logger program.
Connect the red wire to a 12V terminal to constantly power the sensor for troubleshooting
purposes. With the red wire connected to 12V, a voltmeter can be used to check the output
voltage for temperature and relative humidity on the yellow and blue wires respectively
(temperature °C = mV * 0.14 – 80.0; relative humidity % = mV * 0.1).
Symptom: Incorrect temperature or relative humidity
1. Verify the multiplier and offset parameters are correct for the desired units (Data logger
programming (p. 10)).

Maintenance
The HMP155A probe requires minimal maintenance. Check monthly to make sure the radiation
shield is free from debris. The white screen at the tip of the probe should also be checked for
contaminates.
When installed in close proximity to the ocean or other bodies of salt water, a coating of salt
(mostly NaCl) may build up on the radiation shield, sensor, filter and even the chip. NaCl has an
affinity for water. The humidity over a saturated NaCl solution is 75%. A buildup of salt on the
filter or chip will delay or destroy the response to atmospheric humidity.
The filter can be rinsed gently in distilled water. If necessary, the chip can be removed and rinsed
as well. Do not scratch the chip while cleaning.
Recalibrate the HMP155A annually. Refer to the Assistance page at the back of this document for
the procedure for returning the HMP155A to the factory to get recalibrated.

Cleaning
Clean the probe with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with mild detergent.
Changing the probe filter
1. Remove the filter from the probe.
2. After removing the filter, check the O-ring and change it if necessary.
3. Install a new filter on the probe.
New filters can be ordered from Campbell Scientific or Vaisala.


HygroVue Maintenance

Syptoms, Possible causes and Solutions:

1. Temperature is reported as
–9999 or NAN, and relative
humidity is reported as 0 or
an unchanging value.

This indicates a problem
with the SDI-12
communications with the
sensor.

Recheck the sensor wiring.
Check the voltage to the sensor is 12V
with a digital voltage meter.
Verify the sensor SDI-12 address
matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.

2. Inaccurate temperature or
relative humidity is
reported.

Inadequate delay after
power-up (only applicable
if using SW12)
The sensor element has
been contaminated
Electrical interference

Verify the program is allowing a
power-up time of at least 1.8 s.
Clean the sensor tip with distilled
water or replace it.
Ensure the sensor is not installed too
close to a radio transmitter or cell
phone.

3. Temperature and relative
humidity read –99.999

This indicates a fault with
the sensor element itself or
communication between
the sensor element and the
electronics in the sensor
body.

Check the sensor element is properly
plugged in with the correct
orientation.
Check for water being present under
the sensor element connector and
there is no corrosion of the sensor
pins or the socket.
Swap the element for another one.


Maintenance
The HygroVue 10 sensor requires minimal maintenance, but dust, debris, and salts on the filter
cap will degrade sensor performance. Check the white filter on the end of the sensor for debris. If
dirt or salt is ingrained in the filter, clean with distilled water or replace it. Make sure the filter is
screwed onto the sensor firmly with your fingers—do not over tighten.
Check the radiation shield monthly to make sure it is free from dust and debris. To clean the
shield, first remove the sensor. Dismount the shield. Brush all loose dirt off. If more effort is
needed, use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth or brush to thoroughly clean the shield. Allow
the shield to dry before remounting.
CAUTION:
The HygroVue 10 sensor body is sealed and filled with a potting compound to totally protect
the electronics from any water ingress. This means there are no serviceable parts within the
sensor body


Calibration
The life of the sensor element is primarily limited by drift of the humidity sensor and your own
acceptance of the errors incurred. Typical drift is less than 1% per year when used in cleaner
environments but can be higher in polluted air. Because it can be difficult to know what the
sensor has been exposed to, and because the element is relatively inexpensive, Campbell
Scientific recommends replacing the sensor element annually. Replacing the element effectively
brings the sensor back to a factory calibration state both for temperature and relative humidity.
If you wish to check an old element’s calibration, you can measure its performance by plugging it
into another sensor body in your calibration laboratory.
NOTE:
We cannot guarantee the accuracy of measurements if the sensor element is not changed
every yea
