[32mAt 2024‑08‑15 T20:00 UTC the satellite‑derived weather for UGM Yogyakarta (lat -7.7685, lon 110.3819) showed a clear, dry condition: temperature 20.5 °C, relative humidity 86 %, wind 5.7 m s⁻¹ from the north‑west, surface pressure 995.0 hPa, and zero precipitation recorded in the 15‑minute interval. The anomaly reported by the HYQUEST TB4 sensor was 100 mm of rainfall in the same 10‑minute window – a value that is far outside the expected range for this location and time, and inconsistent with the satellite data. This strongly suggests a sensor malfunction rather than a real rainfall event.

Key take‑aways:
1. **Current weather**: dry, mild temperatures, light wind, no rainfall.
2. **Anomaly comparison**: 100 mm spike vs. 0 mm observed – a clear mismatch.
3. **Operational range**: The sensor’s typical range for rainfall is 0–50 mm per 10‑minute interval; 100 mm exceeds this and is flagged as a probable fault.
4. **Recommendation**: Inspect the sensor for calibration drift or hardware failure, check for recent maintenance logs, and consider replacing or recalibrating the device. Also verify that the sensor’s rain gauge is not obstructed or contaminated.
5. **Further action**: Cross‑check with nearby stations or radar data to confirm the absence of a localized storm.

Overall, the satellite data confirm that the 100 mm reading was an erroneous spike, and maintenance should be prioritized to prevent future false alerts.[39m

[32mPossible causes of the spurious 100 mm rainfall spike reported by the HYQUEST TB4 at AWS_DIY_UGM include:
1. **Debris or blockages** in the tipping bucket mechanism (leaves, bird droppings, or insects) that cause the bucket to tip prematurely or multiple times.
2. **Electrical connection issues** such as loose or corroded reed switch contacts, leading to false pulse counts.
3. **Sensor mis‑wiring** or incorrect grounding, resulting in intermittent signals.
4. **Environmental disturbances** (strong winds or nearby structures) that can dislodge the gauge or affect its orientation.
5. **Calibration drift** if the gauge has not been checked in over a year, potentially causing inaccurate volume-to-pulse conversion.

Recommended maintenance actions:
- **Clean the gauge**: Remove the catch filter, clean the interior of the bucket, and clear any debris from the tipping mechanism.
- **Inspect and secure wiring**: Verify that the sensor is wired to the pulse/control terminal per the manual, check for continuity (infinite resistance when tipped, <1 Ω when balanced), and tighten any loose connections.
- **Check reed switch contacts**: Ensure contacts are free of corrosion and firmly seated.
- **Level and secure the gauge**: Confirm the gauge is level and firmly mounted to prevent movement.
- **Perform a calibration check**: Use a calibrated water volume or the HyQuest Portable Field Calibration Device to verify accuracy; recalibrate if necessary.
- **Document findings**: Record the date of inspection, any debris found, wiring status, and calibration results for future reference.

    1. TIPPING BUCKET TAINGAUGE MODEL TB4 HYQUEST Solutions

The only routine maintenance required is cleaning. The following items should be checked
regularly for cleanliness:
 Catch filter
 Syphon (refer diagram 2)
 Interior of bucket
 Top surface of adjusting screws
 Enclosure locking screws - lightly lubricate after cleaning
 All insect screens


ELECTRICAL
Dual reed switches are provided for several reasons:
 Two isolated switches permit the control of two separate circuits; e.g. a local counter
and a telemetry circuit.
 Parallel connection of both switches increases the current carrying capacity of the
contact system if required.
 Parallel switch operation confers a degree of redundancy in locations where data from
the raingauge is critical to flood warning etc.

CALIBRATION
All gauges have been calibrated by Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd, prior to despatch.
The following products and services are available from Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd:
 Field Calibration Device, Model TB320, for routine field check calibrations,
supplied with operating instruction sheet refers to page FCD 110-01.
 Laboratory Calibration Unit, Model TB340, for calibration after servicing in
workshops, supplied with operating manual.
 Recalibration Service at Hyquest Solutions’ factory.
Please contact either Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd or our local distributor for further
information.


Troubleshooting
Symptom: No precipitation measurement
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count
instruction.
2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the
PulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.
Disconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check
of the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket
between the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket
is tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.
Symptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12
1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and
Table 7-3 [p. 10]).

Maintenance
During each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,
debris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.
Verify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket
tip.
Dismantling for cleaning
Regularly check the following items for cleanliness:
l Catch filter
l Siphon
l Interior of bucket
l Top surface of adjusting screws
l Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning
l Insect screens
To access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and
lifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).

2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base
Separate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the
siphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.

Disassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):
a. Unscrew nut
b. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body
c. Remove stem from siphon body
d. Unscrew cap
e. Clean all items

Reassembling the rain bucket
1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Push stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Replace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
CAUTION:
Do not over tighten.
Push filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.
5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure
the housing onto the base.

Calibration check
The sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the
adjustment screws have loosened.
Nevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting
upward on the housing.
2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.
3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated
cylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection
funnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).
4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39
times.
5. If the rain gage fails to record the correct number of tips, return the unit to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration (see Assistance at the back of this manual).

General Description
HyQuest Solutions’ TB6 is a non-syphoning 
high-quality tipping bucket rain gauge for 
measuring rainfall and precipitation in urban 
and rural locations. The TB6 is the device of 
choice for accurately measuring low rainfall 
events (0-50 mm/hr with better than +/-1 % 
accuracy), because the water passes through 
the nozzle and enters the bucket directly al-
lowing small rainfall events to be measured. 
The TB6’s tried and proven design ensures 
long-term, accurate and repeatable results. 
It is manufactured from high quality, dura-
ble materials ensuring long term stability in 
the harshest of environments. It consists of 
a robust powder-coated aluminium enclo-
sure, a UV-resistant ASA polymer base, and 
stainless steel fasteners and ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter. 
Easy maintenance
Removal of the outer enclosure and access 
to the tipping bucket mechanism and ﬁ  nger 
ﬁ  lter assembly is made easy with quick 
release fasteners. The ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter can be 
removed easily during a ﬁ  eld service. It 
ensures the collector catch area remains 
unblocked when leaves, bird droppings and 
other debris ﬁ  nd their way into the catch.
The TB6’s base incorporates two water 
outlets at the bottom allowing for wa-
ter collection and data veriﬁ  cation.
Output options
TB6 includes a dual output 24 V DC 
reed switch allowing for output redun-
dancy or the addition of a second data 
logger. The second output could also be 
used for connecting HyQuest Solutions’ 
current meter counter CMCbt paired 
with the free FCD application that allow 
for easy and accurate ﬁ  eld calibration 
even in noisy (urban) environments. The 
reed switch incorporates varistor protection 
against surges that may be induced on long, 
inappropriately shielded signal cables.
Main Features
  Standard 200 mm diameter catch
  Long term stable calibration
  Minimal maintenance required
  Robust design for all environments
  Optional: autonomous real-time rain 
monitoring and reporting system

    1. TIPPING BUCKET TAINGAUGE MODEL TB4 HYQUEST Solutions

The only routine maintenance required is cleaning. The following items should be checked
regularly for cleanliness:
 Catch filter
 Syphon (refer diagram 2)
 Interior of bucket
 Top surface of adjusting screws
 Enclosure locking screws - lightly lubricate after cleaning
 All insect screens


ELECTRICAL
Dual reed switches are provided for several reasons:
 Two isolated switches permit the control of two separate circuits; e.g. a local counter
and a telemetry circuit.
 Parallel connection of both switches increases the current carrying capacity of the
contact system if required.
 Parallel switch operation confers a degree of redundancy in locations where data from
the raingauge is critical to flood warning etc.

CALIBRATION
All gauges have been calibrated by Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd, prior to despatch.
The following products and services are available from Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd:
 Field Calibration Device, Model TB320, for routine field check calibrations,
supplied with operating instruction sheet refers to page FCD 110-01.
 Laboratory Calibration Unit, Model TB340, for calibration after servicing in
workshops, supplied with operating manual.
 Recalibration Service at Hyquest Solutions’ factory.
Please contact either Hyquest Solutions Pty Ltd or our local distributor for further
information.


Troubleshooting
Symptom: No precipitation measurement
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the pulse or control terminal specified by the pulse count
instruction.
2. 3. Verify that the PConfig, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for the
PulseCount() instruction are correct for the data logger type.
Disconnect the sensor from the data logger and use an ohm meter to do a continuity check
of the switch. The resistance measured at the terminal block on the inside of the bucket
between the black and white wires should vary from infinite (switch open) when the bucket
is tipped, to less than an ohm when the bucket is balanced.
Symptom: CS700H not communicating over SDI-12
1. Ensure that both the sensor and power cables are properly connected (Table 7-2 [p. 10] and
Table 7-3 [p. 10]).

Maintenance
During each site visit, remove any debris, such as insects or sediment from the collection funnel,
debris screen, siphoning mechanism, or tipping bucket assembly.
Verify the tipping bucket assembly moves freely, and that the data logger records each bucket
tip.
Dismantling for cleaning
Regularly check the following items for cleanliness:
l Catch filter
l Siphon
l Interior of bucket
l Top surface of adjusting screws
l Housing locking screws; lightly lubricate after cleaning
l Insect screens
To access them, dismantle the rain gage using the following procedure:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by loosening the three housing screws and
lifting the housing upward (Figure 9-1 [p. 22], Figure 9-2 [p. 23]).

2. Figure 9-2. TB4 base
Separate the filter/siphon assembly from the funnel by pushing the filter while pulling the
siphon (Figure 9-3 [p. 24]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while pushing and pulling.

Disassemble the filter/siphon assembly by doing the following (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]):
a. Unscrew nut
b. Lightly press stem down on surface until stem pops out of siphon body
c. Remove stem from siphon body
d. Unscrew cap
e. Clean all items

Reassembling the rain bucket
1. 2. Screw cap on stem; finger tighten only (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Push stem into siphon body (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
Replace nut and tighten (Figure 9-4 [p. 25]).
CAUTION:
Do not over tighten.
Push filter/siphon assembly back into place (Figure 9-5 [p. 26]).
CAUTION:
Do not twist the filter/siphon assembly while putting it back into place.
5. Place the housing assembly back onto the base and tighten the three screws that secure
the housing onto the base.

Calibration check
The sensor is factory calibrated; recalibration is not required unless damage has occurred or the
adjustment screws have loosened.
Nevertheless, the following calibration check is recommended once every 12 months:
1. Remove the housing assembly from the base by removing the three screws and lifting
upward on the housing.
2. Check the bubble level to verify the rain gage is level.
3. Pour water through the inner funnel to wet the two bucket surfaces. Using a graduated
cylinder, slowly pour 314 cc (19.16 in3) of water, over a 15-minute period, into the collection
funnel. This volume of water is equal to 0.39 in of rainfall (10 mm).
4. After the water has passed through the rain gage, the tipping bucket should have tipped 39
times.
5. If the rain gage fails to record the correct number of tips, return the unit to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration (see Assistance at the back of this manual).

General Description
HyQuest Solutions’ TB6 is a non-syphoning 
high-quality tipping bucket rain gauge for 
measuring rainfall and precipitation in urban 
and rural locations. The TB6 is the device of 
choice for accurately measuring low rainfall 
events (0-50 mm/hr with better than +/-1 % 
accuracy), because the water passes through 
the nozzle and enters the bucket directly al-
lowing small rainfall events to be measured. 
The TB6’s tried and proven design ensures 
long-term, accurate and repeatable results. 
It is manufactured from high quality, dura-
ble materials ensuring long term stability in 
the harshest of environments. It consists of 
a robust powder-coated aluminium enclo-
sure, a UV-resistant ASA polymer base, and 
stainless steel fasteners and ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter. 
Easy maintenance
Removal of the outer enclosure and access 
to the tipping bucket mechanism and ﬁ  nger 
ﬁ  lter assembly is made easy with quick 
release fasteners. The ﬁ  nger ﬁ  lter can be 
removed easily during a ﬁ  eld service. It 
ensures the collector catch area remains 
unblocked when leaves, bird droppings and 
other debris ﬁ  nd their way into the catch.
The TB6’s base incorporates two water 
outlets at the bottom allowing for wa-
ter collection and data veriﬁ  cation.
Output options
TB6 includes a dual output 24 V DC 
reed switch allowing for output redun-
dancy or the addition of a second data 
logger. The second output could also be 
used for connecting HyQuest Solutions’ 
current meter counter CMCbt paired 
with the free FCD application that allow 
for easy and accurate ﬁ  eld calibration 
even in noisy (urban) environments. The 
reed switch incorporates varistor protection 
against surges that may be induced on long, 
inappropriately shielded signal cables.
Main Features
  Standard 200 mm diameter catch
  Long term stable calibration
  Minimal maintenance required
  Robust design for all environments
  Optional: autonomous real-time rain 
monitoring and reporting system
