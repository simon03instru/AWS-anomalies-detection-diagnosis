Query #1:
  Query: Young 05103-L wind direction sensor specifications valid operating range sentinel values sensitivity
  Dataset: sensor_knowledge
  Node Sets: wind_sensor
  Results: 2
  
  Document Chunks:
    1. R.M. Young Wind Monitor maintenance
Preventive maintenance for R.M. Young Wind Monitor includes:

-Checking the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer at least every second year. If the bearings are noisy or wind speed threshold increases above an acceptable level, replace the bearings.
After replacing the bearings, update the maintenance information in the Web UI.
-If the sensor measurement data looks suspicious after the maintenance operation, recalibrate the sensor.
R.M. Young suggests that the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer be
inspected at least every 24 months. Only a qualified technician should perform
the replacement.
Troubleshooting
7.1 Wind Direction
Symptom: -9999 or no change in direction
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Excitation and Single-Ended channel
specified by the measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the excitation voltage and Range code are correct for the
datalogger type.
3. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohn meter to check the
potentiometer. Resistance should be about 10K ohms between the Blue and
White wires. The resistance between either the Blue/Green or White/Green
wires should vary between 1K to 11K depending on the vane position.
Resistance when the vane is in the 5 degree dead band should be about 1 M
ohm.
Symptom: Incorrect wind direction
1. Verify that the Excitation voltage, Range code, multiplier and offset
parameters are correct for the datalogger type.
2. Check orientation of sensor, as described in Section 3.
7.2 Wind Speed
Symptom: No wind speed
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Pulse channel specified by the Pulse
count instruction.
2. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohm meter to check
the coil. The resistance between the red and black wires should be about 2075
ohms. Infinite resistance indicates an open coil; low resistance indicates a
shorted coil.
3. Verify that the Configuration Code, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for
the Pulse Count instruction are correct for the datalogger type.
Symptom: Wind speed does not change
1. For the dataloggers that are programmed with Edlog, the input location for
wind speed is not updated if the datalogger is getting “Program Table
Overruns.” Increase the execution interval (scan rate) to prevent overruns.

Model 18802 Anemometer Drive provides a convenient and accurate way to rotate an anemometer shaft at 
a known rate. The motor may be set to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise at any rate between 200 and 
15,000 RPM in 100 RPM increments. The LCD display is referenced to an accurate and stable quartz timebase. 
For completely portable operation, the unit can be operated on internal batteries. For extended operation, an 
AC wall adapter is included.
Model 18811 Anemometer Drive is identical to Model 18802 except the drive motor incorporates a 
gear reducer for operation in the range of 20 to 990 RPM in 10 RPM increments. The lower range 
is recommended for cup anemometer calibration.
Model 18112 Vane Angle Bench Stand is used for benchtop wind direction calibration of the Wind Monitor 
family of sensors. The mounting post engages the direction orientation notch on the Wind Monitor. An easy to 
read pointer indicates 0 to 360 degrees with 1/2 degree resolution.
Model 18212 Vane Angle Fixture - Tower Mount similar to the Model 18112, the tower mount feature allows use 
on the tower as well as the bench top. The fixture is temporarily placed on the tower between the Wind Monitor 
and its tower mounting. Index keys and notches are engaged to preserve direction reference.
Model 18310 Propeller Torque Disc checks anemometer bearing torque with 0.1 gm/cm resolu-
tion. The disc temporarily replaces the propeller for torque measurement or simple yet accurate pass/fail 
checks. Charts included with the unit relate torque to propeller threshold with limits for acceptable 
bearing performance.
Model 18312 Cup-Wheel Torque Disc checks cup anemometer bearing torque.
Model 18331 Vane Torque Gauge checks vane bearing torque of the Wind Monitor family sensors. Slip the 
fixture over the main housing and make simple yet accurate vane torque measurements. Charts relating vane 
torque to vane threshold provide limits for acceptable bearing performance.
Model 18301 Vane Alignment Rod helps align the vane of a wind sensor to a known direction reference during 
installation. The base of the device has an index key that engages the direction orientation notch in the sensor 
allowing the sensor to be removed without losing wind direction reference.

WIND MONITOR
MODEL 05103

Page 2:

05103-90(N)
INTRODUCTION
The Wind Monitor measures horizontal wind speed and direction.  
Originally developed for ocean data buoy use, it is rugged and 
corrosion resistant yet accurate and light weight. The main housing, 
nose cone, propeller, and other internal parts are injection molded 
U.V. stabilized plastic. Both the propeller and vertical shafts use 
stainless steel precision grade ball bearings.  Bearings have light 
contacting teflon seals and are filled with a wide temperature range 
grease to help exclude contamination and moisture.
Propeller rotation produces an AC sine wave signal with frequency 
proportional to wind speed. This AC signal is induced in a 
stationary coil by a six pole magnet mounted on the propeller 
shaft. Three complete sine wave cycles are produced for each 
propeller revolution.
Vane position is transmitted by a 10K ohm precision conductive 
plastic potentiometer which requires a regulated excitation 
voltage. With a constant voltage applied to the potentiometer, 
the output signal is an analog voltage directly proportional to 
wind  direction angle.
The instrument mounts on standard one inch pipe, outside diameter 
34 mm (1.34"). An orientation ring is provided so the instrument 
can be removed for maintenance and reinstalled without loss of 
wind direction reference. Both the mounting post assembly and 
the orientation ring are secured to the mounting pipe by stainless 
steel band clamps. Electrical connections are made in a junction 
box at the base. A variety of devices are available for signal 
conditioning, display, and recording of wind speed and direction.  
INITIAL CHECKOUT
When the Wind Monitor is unpacked it should be checked carefully 
for any signs of shipping damage.  
Remove the plastic nut on the propeller shaft. Install the propeller 
on the shaft so the serial number on the propeller faces forward 
(into the wind). Engage the propeller into the molded ribs on the 
propeller shaft hub. The instrument is aligned, balanced and fully 
calibrated before shipment, however, it should be checked both 
mechanically and electrically before installation. The vane and 
propeller should easily rotate 360° without friction. Check vane 
balance by holding the instrument base so the vane surface is 
horizontal. It should have near neutral torque without any particular 
tendency to rotate. A slight imbalance will not degrade performance.
The potentiometer requires a stable DC excitation voltage.  Do 
not exceed 15 volts. When the potentiometer wiper is in the 5° 
deadband region, the output signal is "floating" and may show 
varying or unpredictable values. To prevent false readings,  signal 
conditioning electronics should clamp the signal to excitation 
or reference level when this occurs. NOTE: Young signal 
conditioning devices clamp the signal to excitation level. Avoid 
a short circuit between the wind direction signal line and either the 
excitation or reference lines. Although there is a 1K ohm current 
limiting resistor in series with the wiper for protection, damage 
to the potentiometer may occur if a short circuit condition exists.
Before installation, connect the instrument to an indicator as shown 
in the wiring diagram and check for proper wind speed and wind 
direction values. To check wind speed, temporarily remove the 
propeller and connect the shaft to an Anemometer Drive. Details 
appear in the CALIBRATION section of this manual.

INSTALLATION
Proper placement of the instrument is very important. Eddies from 
trees, buildings, or other structures can greatly influence wind 
speed and wind direction observations. To get meaningful data 
for most applications locate the instrument well above or upwind 
from obstructions. As a general rule, the air flow around a structure 
is disturbed to twice the height of the structure upwind, six times 
the height downwind, and up to twice the height of the structure 
above ground. For some applications it may not be practical or 
necessary to meet these requirements.
FAILURE TO PROPERLY GROUND THE WIND MONITOR  
MAY RESULT IN ERRONEOUS SIGNALS  
OR TRANSDUCER DAMAGE.
Grounding the Wind Monitor is vitally important. Without proper 
grounding, static electrical charge can build up during certain 
atmospheric conditions and discharge through the transducers. 
This discharge can cause erroneous signals or transducer failure. 
To direct the discharge away from the transducers, the mounting 
post assembly is made with a special antistatic plastic. It is very 
important that the mounting post be connected to a good earth 
ground. There are two ways this may be accomplished. First, 
the Wind Monitor may be mounted on a metal pipe which is 
connected to earth ground. The mounting pipe should not be 
painted where the Wind Monitor is mounted. Towers or masts 
set in concrete should be connected to one or more grounding 
rods. If it is difficult to ground the mounting post in this manner, 
the following method should be used. Inside the junction box 
the terminal labeled EARTH GND is internally connected to the 
antistatic mounting post. This terminal should be connected to 
an earth ground (Refer to wiring diagram).
Initial installation is most easily done with two people; one to adjust 
the instrument position and the other to observe the indicating 
device. After initial installation, the instrument can be removed 
and returned to its mounting without realigning the vane since 
the orientation ring preserves the wind direction reference. Install 
the Wind Monitor following these steps:
1. MOUNT WIND MONITOR
 a) Place orientation ring on mounting post. Do Not tighten 
band clamp yet.
 b) Place Wind Monitor on mounting post. Do Not tighten 
band clamp yet. 
  
2. CONNECT SENSOR CABLE
 a) Refer to wiring diagram located at back of manual.
 
3. ALIGN VANE
 a) Connect instrument to an indicator.
 b) Choose a known wind direction reference point on the 
horizon.
 c) Sighting down instrument centerline, point nose cone at  
reference point on horizon.
 d) While holding vane in position, slowly turn base until 
indicator shows proper value.
 e) Tighten mounting post band clamp.
 f) Engage orientation ring indexing pin in notch at 
instrument base.
 g) Tighten orientation ring band clamp.
CALIBRATION
The Wind Monitor is fully calibrated before shipment and should 
require no adjustments. Recalibration may be necessary after 
some maintenance operations. Periodic calibration checks are 
desirable and may be necessary where the instrument is used in 
programs which require auditing of sensor performance.
Accurate wind direction calibration requires a Model 18112 Vane 
Angle Bench Stand. Begin by connecting the instrument to a 
signal conditioning circuit which has some method of indicating 
wind direction value. This may be a display which shows wind 
direction values in angular degrees or simply a voltmeter 
monitoring the output. Orient the base so the junction box faces 
due south. Visually align the vane with the crossmarkings and 
observe the indicator output. If the vane position and indicator 
do not agree within 5°, adjust the potentiometer coupling inside 
the main housing. Details for making this adjustment appear 
in the MAINTENANCE, POTENTIOMETER REPLACEMENT, 
outline, step 7. 
It is important to note that, while the sensor mechanically rotates 
through 360°, the full scale wind direction signal from the signal 
conditioning occurs at 355°. The signal conditioning electronics 
must be adjusted accordingly. For example, in a circuit where 0 
to 1.000 VDC represents 0° to 360°, the output must be adjusted 
for 0.986 VDC when the instrument is at 355°. (355°/360° X 1.000 
volts = 0.986 volts)
Wind speed calibration is determined by propeller pitch and the 
output characteristics of the transducer. Calibration formulas 
showing wind speed vs. propeller rpm and output frequency are 
included below. Standard accuracy is ± 0.3 m/s (0.6mph). For 
greater accuracy, the sensor must be individually calibrated in 
comparison with a wind speed standard. Contact the factory or 
your supplier to schedule a NIST (National Institute of Standards 
& Technology) traceable wind tunnel calibration in our facility.
 
To calibrate wind system electronics using a signal from the 
instrument, temporarily remove the propeller and connect an 
Anemometer Drive (18802 or equivalent)  to the propeller shaft. 
Apply the appropriate calibration formula to the calibrating motor 
rpm and adjust the electronics for the proper value. For example, 
with the propeller shaft turning at 3600 rpm, adjust an indicator to 
display 17.6 meters per second [3600 rpm  X 0.00490 (m/s)/rpm 
=17.6 m/s]
Details on checking bearing torque, which affects wind speed and 
direction threshold, appear in the following section.

MAINTENANCE
Given proper care, the Wind Monitor should provide years of 
service. The only components likely to need replacement due to 
normal wear are the precision ball bearings and the wind direction 
potentiometer. Only a qualified instrument technician should 
perform the replacement. If service facilities are not available, 
return the instrument to the company. Refer to the drawings to 
become familiar with part names and locations. The asterisk * 
which appears in the following outlines is a reminder that maximum 
torque on all set screws is 80 oz-in.

  Document Chunks:
    1. R.M. Young Wind Monitor maintenance
Preventive maintenance for R.M. Young Wind Monitor includes:

-Checking the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer at least every second year. If the bearings are noisy or wind speed threshold increases above an acceptable level, replace the bearings.
After replacing the bearings, update the maintenance information in the Web UI.
-If the sensor measurement data looks suspicious after the maintenance operation, recalibrate the sensor.
R.M. Young suggests that the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer be
inspected at least every 24 months. Only a qualified technician should perform
the replacement.
Troubleshooting
7.1 Wind Direction
Symptom: -9999 or no change in direction
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Excitation and Single-Ended channel
specified by the measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the excitation voltage and Range code are correct for the
datalogger type.
3. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohn meter to check the
potentiometer. Resistance should be about 10K ohms between the Blue and
White wires. The resistance between either the Blue/Green or White/Green
wires should vary between 1K to 11K depending on the vane position.
Resistance when the vane is in the 5 degree dead band should be about 1 M
ohm.
Symptom: Incorrect wind direction
1. Verify that the Excitation voltage, Range code, multiplier and offset
parameters are correct for the datalogger type.
2. Check orientation of sensor, as described in Section 3.
7.2 Wind Speed
Symptom: No wind speed
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Pulse channel specified by the Pulse
count instruction.
2. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohm meter to check
the coil. The resistance between the red and black wires should be about 2075
ohms. Infinite resistance indicates an open coil; low resistance indicates a
shorted coil.
3. Verify that the Configuration Code, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for
the Pulse Count instruction are correct for the datalogger type.
Symptom: Wind speed does not change
1. For the dataloggers that are programmed with Edlog, the input location for
wind speed is not updated if the datalogger is getting “Program Table
Overruns.” Increase the execution interval (scan rate) to prevent overruns.

Model 18802 Anemometer Drive provides a convenient and accurate way to rotate an anemometer shaft at 
a known rate. The motor may be set to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise at any rate between 200 and 
15,000 RPM in 100 RPM increments. The LCD display is referenced to an accurate and stable quartz timebase. 
For completely portable operation, the unit can be operated on internal batteries. For extended operation, an 
AC wall adapter is included.
Model 18811 Anemometer Drive is identical to Model 18802 except the drive motor incorporates a 
gear reducer for operation in the range of 20 to 990 RPM in 10 RPM increments. The lower range 
is recommended for cup anemometer calibration.
Model 18112 Vane Angle Bench Stand is used for benchtop wind direction calibration of the Wind Monitor 
family of sensors. The mounting post engages the direction orientation notch on the Wind Monitor. An easy to 
read pointer indicates 0 to 360 degrees with 1/2 degree resolution.
Model 18212 Vane Angle Fixture - Tower Mount similar to the Model 18112, the tower mount feature allows use 
on the tower as well as the bench top. The fixture is temporarily placed on the tower between the Wind Monitor 
and its tower mounting. Index keys and notches are engaged to preserve direction reference.
Model 18310 Propeller Torque Disc checks anemometer bearing torque with 0.1 gm/cm resolu-
tion. The disc temporarily replaces the propeller for torque measurement or simple yet accurate pass/fail 
checks. Charts included with the unit relate torque to propeller threshold with limits for acceptable 
bearing performance.
Model 18312 Cup-Wheel Torque Disc checks cup anemometer bearing torque.
Model 18331 Vane Torque Gauge checks vane bearing torque of the Wind Monitor family sensors. Slip the 
fixture over the main housing and make simple yet accurate vane torque measurements. Charts relating vane 
torque to vane threshold provide limits for acceptable bearing performance.
Model 18301 Vane Alignment Rod helps align the vane of a wind sensor to a known direction reference during 
installation. The base of the device has an index key that engages the direction orientation notch in the sensor 
allowing the sensor to be removed without losing wind direction reference.

Query #5:
  Query: Young 05103-L wind direction sensor sentinel value -9999.0° communication failure troubleshooting steps

  Results: 2
  
  Document Chunks:
    1. R.M. Young Wind Monitor maintenance
Preventive maintenance for R.M. Young Wind Monitor includes:

-Checking the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer at least every second year. If the bearings are noisy or wind speed threshold increases above an acceptable level, replace the bearings.
After replacing the bearings, update the maintenance information in the Web UI.
-If the sensor measurement data looks suspicious after the maintenance operation, recalibrate the sensor.
R.M. Young suggests that the anemometer bearings and the potentiometer be
inspected at least every 24 months. Only a qualified technician should perform
the replacement.
Troubleshooting
7.1 Wind Direction
Symptom: -9999 or no change in direction
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Excitation and Single-Ended channel
specified by the measurement instruction.
2. Verify that the excitation voltage and Range code are correct for the
datalogger type.
3. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohn meter to check the
potentiometer. Resistance should be about 10K ohms between the Blue and
White wires. The resistance between either the Blue/Green or White/Green
wires should vary between 1K to 11K depending on the vane position.
Resistance when the vane is in the 5 degree dead band should be about 1 M
ohm.
Symptom: Incorrect wind direction
1. Verify that the Excitation voltage, Range code, multiplier and offset
parameters are correct for the datalogger type.
2. Check orientation of sensor, as described in Section 3.
7.2 Wind Speed
Symptom: No wind speed
1. Check that the sensor is wired to the Pulse channel specified by the Pulse
count instruction.
2. Disconnect the sensor from the datalogger and use an ohm meter to check
the coil. The resistance between the red and black wires should be about 2075
ohms. Infinite resistance indicates an open coil; low resistance indicates a
shorted coil.
3. Verify that the Configuration Code, and Multiplier and Offset parameters for
the Pulse Count instruction are correct for the datalogger type.
Symptom: Wind speed does not change
1. For the dataloggers that are programmed with Edlog, the input location for
wind speed is not updated if the datalogger is getting “Program Table
Overruns.” Increase the execution interval (scan rate) to prevent overruns.
