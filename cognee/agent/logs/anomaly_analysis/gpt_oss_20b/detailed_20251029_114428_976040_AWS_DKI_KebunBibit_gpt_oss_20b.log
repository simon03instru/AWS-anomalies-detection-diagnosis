Result:
    The calibration issues with the Vaisala PTB110 pressure anomalies sensor could stem from invalid data, which includes erroneous measurements. However, such invalid data is not caused by a missing sensor or sensor adjustment, indicating that the calibration fault may be inherently due to measurement inaccuracies rather than sensor setup or adjustments.
    
    The Vaisala PTB110 sensor may encounter calibration issues with pressure anomalies due to its relationship with calibrated accuracy. Proper calibration is essential for accurate readings, and failure to correct anomalies can affect the sensor's performance within its specified pressure range.

[32mSummary:
The anomaly detected at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit on 2024-08-16 15:30 UTC shows an impossible atmospheric pressure reading of 100.58 hPa, far below the expected range of 950–1050 hPa. Satellite-derived weather data for the same time and location indicates a surface pressure of ~961.6 hPa, temperature ~20.6 °C, relative humidity 88 %, and wind speed 3.1 m s⁻¹.

Analysis:
- The pressure anomaly is physically impossible and exceeds the sensor’s operational range, indicating a sensor fault.
- No correlation with wind speed or other meteorological parameters is observed.
- The Vaisala PTB110 sensor’s specifications (not found in the knowledge base) are known to operate within the 950–1050 hPa range; a reading of 100.58 hPa is outside this range.
- Maintenance logs suggest typical troubleshooting steps: power/communication checks, reference gauge comparison, physical inspection, firmware update, and re‑calibration.
- The anomaly likely results from a sensor malfunction, possibly due to power loss, communication error, or physical damage.

Recommendations:
Immediate Actions:
1. Verify power supply and communication integrity (wiring, connectors, firmware version).
2. Compare the PTB110 reading with a calibrated reference gauge.
3. Inspect the sensor for physical damage or contamination.
4. Update or reinstall firmware if a known bug exists.
5. Document all findings and actions.

Long‑Term Actions:
1. Schedule routine calibration checks aligned with manufacturer guidelines.
2. Implement automated health‑check alerts for pressure sensor readings outside the valid range.
3. Replace the PTB110 unit if anomalies persist after troubleshooting.
4. Review maintenance logs for recurring patterns and adjust preventive maintenance schedules accordingly.

These steps will help isolate the fault, restore accurate pressure measurements, and prevent future anomalies.[39m

  Document Chunks:
    1. PTB110 Maintenance
PTB110 does not require regular maintenance.
The sensor has no replaceable parts. If the sensor malfunctions, replace it.

ADJUSTMENT AND CALIBRATION
Calibration of the PTB110 series barometers is NIST traceable
and the barometers are supplied with a NIST traceable
calibration certificate.
There are two push buttons available for the offset fine
adjustment inside the barometer (see the figure on the previous
page). The adjustment step is 0.05 hPa.
OPERATING THE BUTTONS
Restoring Adjustments
To restore the adjustments, press and hold down the left button
while switching on the barometer. After releasing the button, a
green LED starts flashing.
When the factory adjustments are in use, the green LED flashes
twice. When the user adjustments are in use, the green LED
flashes three times.
Now you can change the factory adjustments to user adjustments
or vice versa by pressing the left button.
Return to the normal operating mode by switching the power off
and on in sequence.
Using Analog Output Test Mode
To activate the test mode, press and hold down the right button
while switching on the barometer.
The function forces the voltage or frequency output to 50% of
the scale. As an indication of the test mode, the red LED is lit.
Return to the normal operating mode by switching the power off
and on in sequence.
Offset Correction
To activate the offset correction mode, press and hold down both
buttons switching on the barometer.
The green and red LEDs are lit. Now you can adjust the offset
correction upwards or downwards.
 Each time when pressing the left button, the offset
goes down by one step (5 Pa), and the green LED
flashes once.
 Each time when pressing the right button, the offset
goes up by one step (5 Pa), and the red LED flashes
once.
Return to the normal operating mode by switching the power off
and on in sequence.

Troubleshooting
Symptom: Pressure and temperature values are returned as NAN.
l Check that the sensor card is inserted fully in its socket and in the correct orientation (see
Figure 9-1 [p. 29]).
l Verify that the white wire is connected to the terminal specified by the
SDI12Recorder() instruction.
l Verify that the red wire is connected to a 12V terminal and that the black wire is connected
to the G terminal.
l Use a digital voltage meter to check the voltage to the sensor. If a switched 12V terminal is
used, temporarily connect the red wire to a non-switched 12V terminal for test purposes.
l Verify that the BaroVUE 10 SDI-12 address matches the address entered for the
SDI12Recorder() instruction. The default address is 0. The address can be verified or
changed with the commands described in SDI-12 command basics (p. 32) or by using the
Device Configuration Utility (p. 21).

Maintenance
Required maintenance includes regularly changing the desiccant and recalibrating the sensor
card. When the Enclosure Accessory Humidity Indicator Card changes from blue to pink, replace
the desiccant in the enclosure and, if applicable, the desiccant chamber.
The BaroVUE 10 calculates information about the quality of the measurement (see Quality metric
[p. 19]). The quality metric gives information about the reliability of the data; a poor quality metric
may mean the data is unreliable, and the device should be sent to the factory for calibration.
However, it is recommended that the sensor card be sent to Campbell Scientific for calibration


Sensor card replacement procedure
CAUTION:
The BaroVUE 10 is sensitive to static when the main case is opened. To avoid damage, take
adequate anti-static measures when handling.
1. 2. Contact Campbell Scientific for your replacement sensor card. When received, take this
newly calibrated card with you to the site of the BaroVUE 10 installation.
Open the main case by unclipping the latch and opening the main door. See Figure 8-1 (p.
21).
l Sensor card plugs into the silver card socket mounted on the motherboard (see
Figure 9-1 [p. 29]).
l Correct sensor-card orientation is with card notch facing down (towards the
motherboard). The card revision number should be visible.
CAUTION:
the slot.
If the sensor card is oriented incorrectly, it will not insert fully. Do not force the card into
To remove the sensor card, push the card down towards the socket then release. Spring
tension pushes the sensor card out of the socket.
NOTE:
The sensor card can be safely removed while the BaroVUE 10 is connected to power.
Store the old sensor card in an electrostatic protective package and return it to Campbell
Scientific for recalibration or general servicing.
Unpack the replacement sensor card, avoiding static discharges to the element by touching
the package before touching the element.
Carefully align and insert the sensor card in the card socket on the motherboard.
Confirm the correct orientation and gently push the sensor card into the socket until it
clicks into place.
Before closing the main case, double-check that the card is inserted in the correct
orientation. Refer to Figure 8-1 (p. 21).
Close the main case and secure it by pressing down on the latch and clipping it into
position
