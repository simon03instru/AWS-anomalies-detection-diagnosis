1 Confirmed Anomaly with Trend Analysis:
Anomaly #1: Wind Speed
  Value: 10.377
  Sensor Brand: Young 05103-L
  Trend Analysis: Wind Speed sensor likely malfunction: sudden spike to 10.377 m/s (~1000% above mean of 0.94 m/s), no concurrent pressure drop observed, exceeds typical range (>3σ). Pattern is isolated spike, suggesting sensor output error or calibration issue.

Diagnosis Agent Output
=============================
Assessment/Troubleshoot:
- Weather data at the time (2024-08-15 20:20 UTC) showed ambient wind speeds of 5.5‑5.7 m/s, temperature ~20 °C, pressure ~995 hPa and humidity ~86‑87 %. The sensor reported a sudden spike to 10.377 m/s, roughly double the ambient wind and far above the mean (0.94 m/s) and the 3‑σ threshold used in the trend analysis. This discrepancy cannot be explained by the meteorological conditions and strongly suggests a sensor‑related error.
- Sensor specifications for the Young 05103‑L were not found in the knowledge base, but typical Young cup‑type anemometers are rated up to 30‑40 m/s with an accuracy of ±0.3 m/s. The 10.377 m/s value is within the nominal measurement range, yet the isolated nature of the spike and lack of accompanying pressure changes indicate a malfunction rather than a true wind event.
- Maintenance guidance identifies common failure modes that produce isolated high‑speed spikes: worn bearings or potentiometer, loose or damaged cable connections, and propeller imbalance. Recommended troubleshooting steps include mechanical inspection (rotate cup/vane), cable continuity testing, and checking bearing wear.

Recommendations:
1. **Immediate verification** – Perform a visual and manual check of the cup/vane assembly for free rotation and balance. Verify that the sensor reports zero wind when stationary.
2. **Electrical inspection** – Test cable continuity and connector integrity; reseat or replace any damaged wiring.
3. **Calibration check** – Connect the sensor to a calibrated reference (e.g., anemometer drive) and compare readings. Adjust the potentiometer if signals are erratic.
4. **Component replacement** – If bearing wear or potentiometer damage is observed, replace the bearings and/or potentiometer according to the manufacturer’s service manual.
5. **Re‑calibration** – After any mechanical or electrical repair, perform a full calibration routine (initial checkout, calibration check, potentiometer adjustment, wind‑speed calibration) as outlined in the maintenance guide.
6. **Monitoring plan** – Implement a short‑term monitoring window (e.g., 24‑48 h) with data logging at 1‑minute intervals to confirm stable performance. Set an alert threshold at 3× the site’s mean wind speed (~3 m/s) to catch future spikes early.
7. **Long‑term actions** – Schedule periodic (quarterly) inspections of bearings, cables, and calibration checks, especially during the rainy season when humidity can affect electronics.

Conclusion: The wind‑speed anomaly is most likely due to a sensor fault rather than an actual meteorological event. Following the above verification, maintenance, and monitoring steps should restore reliable wind measurements and prevent recurrence.
