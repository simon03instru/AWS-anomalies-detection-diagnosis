Event Detection Time: 2024-08-19T07:40:00
Station: AWS_DIY_STAGEOF_YOGYAKARTA
Location: Yogyakarta, Indonesia
Coordinates: Latitude -7.81665, Longitude 110.29481, Altitude 48.0m

1 Confirmed Anomaly with Trend Analysis:
Anomaly #1: Wind Direction
  Value: 999.0
  Sensor Brand: Young 05103-L
  Trend Analysis: Invalid sentinel value 999.0° - outside 0-360° range, indicates sensor failure. No valid correlation possible. Immediate fault.

Diagnosis Agent Output
=============================

- **Detection Time (2024-08-19 07:45 UTC)**: Temperature ≈ 28.8 °C, Wind Speed ≈ 20.1 m/s, Wind Direction ≈ 156°, Humidity ≈ 59 %, Pressure ≈ 993.6 hPa
- **Latest Available (2024-08-19 08:00 UTC)**: Temperature ≈ 28.5 °C, Wind Speed ≈ 20.1 m/s, Wind Direction ≈ 156°, Humidity ≈ 60 %, Pressure ≈ 993.6 hPa

The Young 05103‑L wind‑direction sensor has a valid measurement range of 0 to 360° mechanically (355° electrically, with a 5° open circuit). 
Sentinel values such as 999.0° fall outside this range and indicate a communication or sensor fault. 
Its sensitivity threshold is 1.1 m/s (≈2.5 mph) at a 10° displacement, and the sensor provides an accuracy of ±0.25% linearity for the potentiometer.

- Verify power supply: ensure stable DC excitation (max 15 V) to the sensor.
- Inspect all cable connections and junction box for secure, undamaged contacts; reseat connectors.
- Perform continuity test on wiring with a multimeter.
- Check grounding: confirm proper grounding of the wind monitor to prevent static discharge.
- Examine the potentiometer for wear or noisy signals; replace if defective.
- Ensure the vane rotates freely without obstruction; manually rotate to confirm movement.
- Re‑calibrate the sensor using a Model 18112 Vane Angle Bench Stand.
- Verify signal‑conditioning electronics are functioning and not causing a floating signal.
- Inspect the sensor for any physical damage.
- If the sentinel value 999 persists after these steps, contact the manufacturer or a qualified technician for further assistance.
