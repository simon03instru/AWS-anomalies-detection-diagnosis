Station Agent Output:
=============================
Event Detection Time: 2024-08-15T20:20:00
Station: AWS_DIY_UGM
Location: UGM Yogyakarta, Indonesia
Coordinates: Latitude -7.768469, Longitude 110.38192, Altitude 48.0m

1 Confirmed Anomaly with Trend Analysis:
Anomaly #1: Atmospheric Pressure
  Value: -9999.0
  Sensor Brand: BaroVue
  Trend Analysis: Invalid sentinel value -9999.0 hPa - sensor communication failure. Expected ~996 hPa, deviation >1000 hPa, physically impossible.

Assessment/Troubleshoot:
- At the event time (2024-08-15 20:20 UTC) the satellite‑derived weather data for the AWS_DIY_UGM site showed a temperature of 20.5 °C, relative humidity 86 %, wind 5.7 m/s from 325°, and a surface pressure of 995 hPa. The station reported a pressure value of -9999 hPa, which is a known sentinel indicating a sensor communication failure.
- The BaroVue pressure sensor’s valid measurement range is 300–1100 hPa with a 0.01 hPa resolution, so the observed 995 hPa is well within the operational range. The reported -9999 hPa is not a physical measurement and far exceeds any plausible deviation (>10 000 hPa), confirming a sensor fault rather than an atmospheric event.

Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Troubleshooting** – Follow the BaroVue maintenance guide:
   - Verify that the sensor card is fully seated and all wiring (power, signal, ground) is secure and free of corrosion.
   - Measure the sensor’s supply voltage (12 V nominal) to ensure it is within spec.
   - Re‑calibrate the sensor according to the manufacturer’s procedure.
2. **If the fault persists** – Replace the BaroVue pressure sensor card with a new unit, observing anti‑static handling.
3. **Enclosure & Environment** – Replace the desiccant in the sensor enclosure, check for condensation, and keep humidity low to prevent future communication issues.
4. **Software/Firmware** – Check for and apply any firmware updates for the sensor or data logger that address communication protocols.
5. **Diagnostics** – Run built‑in diagnostics or apply a known pressure reference to confirm sensor response after each step.
6. **Documentation** – Log the fault, actions taken, and any parts replaced in the station maintenance record.

No other anomalies were reported for this event, so the pressure sensor failure appears isolated. Implementing the above steps should restore reliable pressure measurements and prevent recurrence.
