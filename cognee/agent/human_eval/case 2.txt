Event Detection Time: 2024-08-16T15:20:00

1 Confirmed Anomaly with Trend Analysis:
Anomaly #1: Atmospheric Pressure
  Value: 980.51
  Sensor Brand: Vaisala PTB110
  Trend Analysis: Pressure reading 980.51 hPa is ~23 hPa below recent mean (1002.9 hPa) and far outside observed range (1001.6‑1003.6 hPa). Expected negative correlation with wind speed is absent (ws=0.0), suggesting a sensor fault rather than a real low‑pressure event.

Assessment and Troubleshooting:
- The Vaisala PTB110 reported a surface pressure of 980.51 hPa at 2024‑08‑16T15:20:00, which is ~25 hPa lower than the satellite‑derived pressure of 1006.1 hPa for the same location and time. Temperature (≈12 °C), humidity (≈88 %) and wind speed (≈22 m/s) were typical for the region, indicating no broader meteorological event that could explain such a low pressure.
- The pressure reading lies far outside the recent observed range (1001.6‑1003.6 hPa) and the expected negative correlation with wind speed is absent (wind speed was high but pressure remained low). This pattern is characteristic of a sensor fault rather than a genuine atmospheric event.

Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Visual Inspection** – Check the barometer port for blockages (water, dust, insects, debris) and clean if necessary.
2. **Power & Wiring Check** – Verify that the sensor receives stable voltage, inspect connectors for looseness, corrosion, or damage, and reseat or replace cables as needed.
3. **Cross‑Station Validation** – Compare the pressure reading with the nearest AWS stations (e.g., other stations in Jakarta region). If they all show ~1005 hPa, the anomaly is isolated to this sensor.
4. **Recalibration** – Perform an offset correction using the PTB110’s calibration routine. Record the new offset and monitor the next 24‑48 h of data.
5. **Environmental Review** – Ensure the sensor housing is protected from condensation, extreme temperature swings, and nearby structures that could affect airflow.
6. **Monitoring** – After corrective actions, increase data logging frequency for pressure (e.g., 5‑minute intervals) for at least 48 h and flag any values deviating >5 hPa from the regional mean.
7. **Escalation** – If the low‑pressure bias persists after cleaning, power verification, and recalibration, replace the PTB110 sensor.
8. **Documentation** – Log all inspection steps, findings, and maintenance actions in the station’s maintenance record for future reference.

Overall, the evidence points to a sensor‑related fault. Following the above steps should resolve the issue and restore reliable pressure measurements at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit.
