Station Agent Output
=============================
Event Detection Time: 2024-08-16T15:20:00
Station: AWS_DKI_KebunBibit
Location: Cibubur, Indonesia
Coordinates: Latitude -34.9285, Longitude 138.6007, Altitude 48.0m

2 Confirmed Anomalies with Trend Analysis:
Anomaly #1: Relative Humidity
  Value: 0.0
  Sensor Brand: Vaisala HMP155
  Trend Analysis: Physically impossible 0% humidity reading - sensor fault. Expected ~68%, dropped to 0% instantly. Correlation with temperature broken (low humidity but low temperature).
Anomaly #2: Temperature
  Value: 20.09
  Sensor Brand: Vaisala HMP155
  Trend Analysis: Temperature 20.09°C, ~8°C below recent mean (28°C). Sudden drop inconsistent with humidity trend; likely sensor misreading.

**Assessment**
- The satellite‑derived observation for the site (≈13 °C, 82 % RH) is far from the sensor‑reported values (20.09 °C, 0 % RH). The 0 % humidity reading is physically impossible and the temperature drop of ~8 °C is inconsistent with the recent cooling trend (≈‑0.3 °C h⁻¹). 
- Although the Vaisala HMP155 sensor’s specification lists 0 % RH and 20 °C as being within its nominal operating range, the combination of a zero‑humidity output and a sudden temperature dip strongly points to a sensor fault rather than a true atmospheric event.

**Likely Causes (per maintenance docs)**
1. Loose or incorrect wiring (power or signal leads).
2. Contaminated or damaged sensor probe (water, dust, corrosion).
3. Power‑up delay not met or unstable supply voltage (7‑28 V).
4. Incorrect logger configuration or range code.
5. Environmental exposure (direct precipitation, debris on shield).

**Actionable Recommendations**
1. **Immediate visual inspection** of the HMP155 unit and its wiring; reseat all connectors and verify correct polarity.
2. **Measure supply voltage** at the sensor terminals to confirm it stays within 7‑28 V and that there is no significant drop.
3. **Check signal voltages** on the temperature (yellow) and humidity (blue) wires with a multimeter; values should be stable.
4. **Clean the probe** gently with distilled water; remove any visible moisture, dust, or corrosion. Re‑install the radiation shield if disturbed.
5. **Verify logger configuration** – ensure the correct range code and measurement instructions for the HMP155 are set.
6. **Apply the required power‑up delay** (≥1.8 s) in the data‑logger firmware if using SW12 power.
7. **If abnormal readings persist**, replace the HMP155 sensor with a calibrated spare and update the maintenance log.

**Conclusion**: The evidence points to a malfunctioning Vaisala HMP155 sensor. Follow the inspection, cleaning, and calibration steps first; if the issue is not resolved, schedule a sensor replacement. This will restore reliable temperature and humidity monitoring at AWS_DKI_KebunBibit.
