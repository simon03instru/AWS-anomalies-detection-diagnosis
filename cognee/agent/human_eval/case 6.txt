Station Agent Output:
=============================
Event Detection Time: 2024-08-15T20:20:00
Station: AWS_DIY_UGM
Location: UGM Yogyakarta, Indonesia
Coordinates: Latitude -7.768469, Longitude 110.38192, Altitude 48.0m

1 Confirmed Anomaly with Trend Analysis:
Anomaly #1: Wind Speed
  Value: 0.0
  Sensor Brand: Young 05103-L
  Trend Analysis: Wind Speed stuck at 0.0 m/s at 2024-08-15T20:20:00 UTC (local 03:20+07). This is a >3σ deviation from recent mean 0.94 m/s. No wind recorded for the interval, which is atypical for this location/nighttime. Correlation with pressure appears broken. Likely sensor malfunction.

**Assessment/Troubleshoot**
- Satellite‑derived data for 2024‑08‑15 20:20 UTC at AWS_DIY_UGM shows a moderate breeze (≈5.5 m s⁻¹), temperature ~20.5 °C, pressure ~995 hPa and humidity ~86 %. The station’s wind sensor reported 0.0 m s⁻¹, a >5 m s⁻¹ deviation and >3σ from the recent mean (0.94 m s⁻¹), indicating a clear sensor fault rather than an actual calm‑wind event.
- The Young 05103‑L anemometer’s specifications (though exact numeric limits are not in the knowledge base) are designed for continuous wind measurement; a persistent 0.0 m s⁻¹ reading under normal wind conditions is outside its normal operational range and suggests a loss of signal or mechanical blockage.
- Trend analysis confirms the sensor has been stuck at zero, breaking the expected correlation with surface pressure and recent wind trends.

**Recommended Actions**
1. **Immediate Inspection**
   - Verify all cable connections (check for corrosion, loose plugs, and continuity with a multimeter).
   - Examine the propeller/vane for debris, damage, or seized bearings; rotate manually to confirm free movement.
   - Inspect the potentiometer or electronic output stage; adjust or replace if output is flat.
   - Ensure the sensor and junction box are properly grounded.
2. **Calibration / Testing**
   - Perform a manual rotation test while logging output to confirm any response.
   - Re‑calibrate the sensor using a reference anemometer (e.g., Model 18802) or send it to a calibration lab.
3. **Component Replacement**
   - If cables, bearings, or the potentiometer are defective, replace them.
   - Consider swapping the Young 05103‑L unit with a known‑good spare to rule out internal failure.
4. **Post‑Maintenance Verification**
   - After repairs, monitor wind speed for at least 24 h and compare against satellite data to confirm alignment.
   - Log any recurring zero‑readings and trigger an automated alert if the sensor deviates >2 σ from expected values.
5. **Preventive Measures**
   - Schedule quarterly visual inspections and annual calibration.
   - Install a simple watchdog script that flags prolonged zero values (e.g., >30 min) for rapid response.

By following these steps the station can quickly restore reliable wind measurements and reduce future false‑positive anomalies.
